it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possessionof a good fortune must be in want of a wife.however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on hisfirst entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the mindsof the surrounding families that he is considered the rightful propertyof some one or other of their daughters.my dear mr. bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard thatnetherfield park is let at lastmr. bennet replied that he had not.but it is returned she for mrs. long has just been here and shetold me all about it.mr. bennet made no answer.do you not want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently.you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it.this was invitation enough.why my dear you must know mrs. long says that netherfield is takenby a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he camedown on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so muchdelighted with it that he agreed with mr. morris immediately that heis to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are tobe in the house by the end of next week.what is his namebingley.is he married or singleoh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four orfive thousand a year. what a fine thing for our girlshow so how can it affect themmy dear mr. bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome youmust know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them.is that his design in settling heredesign nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that hemay fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him assoon as he comes.i see no occasion for that. you and the girls may go or you may sendthem by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you areas handsome as any of them mr. bingley may like you the best of theparty.my dear you flatter me. i certainly have had my share of beauty buti do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. when a woman has fivegrownup daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of.but my dear you must indeed go and see mr. bingley when he comes intothe neighbourhood.it is more than i engage for i assure you.but consider your daughters. only think what an establishment it wouldbe for one of them. sir william and lady lucas are determined togo merely on that account for in general you know they visit nonewcomers. indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us tovisit him if you do not.you are overscrupulous surely. i dare say mr. bingley will be veryglad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of myhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls thoughi must throw in a good word for my little lizzy.i desire you will do no such thing. lizzy is not a bit better than theothers and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half sogoodhumoured as lydia. but you are always giving her the preference.they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they areall silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more ofquickness than her sisters.mr. bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way youtake delight in vexing me. you have no compassion for my poor nerves.you mistake me my dear. i have a high respect for your nerves. theyare my old friends. i have heard you mention them with considerationthese last twenty years at least.ah you do not know what i suffer.but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of fourthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will notvisit them.depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit themall.mr. bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humourreserve and caprice that the experience of threeandtwenty years hadbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. her mindwas less difficult to develop. she was a woman of mean understandinglittle information and uncertain temper. when she was discontentedshe fancied herself nervous. the business of her life was to get herdaughters married its solace was visiting and news.chapter mr. bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr. bingley. hehad always intended to visit him though to the last always assuringhis wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit waspaid she had no knowledge of it. it was then disclosed in the followingmanner. observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat hesuddenly addressed her withi hope mr. bingley will like it lizzy.we are not in a way to know what mr. bingley likes said her motherresentfully since we are not to visit.but you forget mamma said elizabeth that we shall meet him at theassemblies and that mrs. long promised to introduce him.i do not believe mrs. long will do any such thing. she has two niecesof her own. she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinionof her.no more have i said mr. bennet and i am glad to find that you donot depend on her serving you.mrs. bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to containherself began scolding one of her daughters.dont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake have a littlecompassion on my nerves. you tear them to pieces.kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she timesthem ill.i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully. when isyour next ball to be lizzytomorrow fortnight.aye so it is cried her mother and mrs. long does not come backtill the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce himfor she will not know him herself.then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introducemr. bingley to her.impossible mr. bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with himmyself how can you be so teasingi honour your circumspection. a fortnights acquaintance is certainlyvery little. one cannot know what a man really is by the end of afortnight. but if we do not venture somebody else will and after allmrs. long and her daughters must stand their chance and therefore asshe will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i willtake it on myself.the girls stared at their father. mrs. bennet said only nonsensenonsensewhat can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he. doyou consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid onthem as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there. what say youmary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and readgreat books and make extracts.mary wished to say something sensible but knew not how.while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr.bingley.i am sick of mr. bingley cried his wife.i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me that before ifi had known as much this morning i certainly would not have calledon him. it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit wecannot escape the acquaintance now.the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs.bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joywas over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all thewhile.how good it was in you my dear mr. bennet but i knew i shouldpersuade you at last. i was sure you loved your girls too well toneglect such an acquaintance. well how pleased i am and it is such agood joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said aword about it till now.now kitty you may cough as much as you choose said mr. bennet andas he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife.what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door wasshut. i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindnessor me either for that matter. at our time of life it is not sopleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintances every day butfor your sakes we would do anything. lydia my love though you arethe youngest i dare say mr. bingley will dance with you at the nextball.oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am theyoungest im the tallest.the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he wouldreturn mr. bennets visit and determining when they should ask him todinner.chapter not all that mrs. bennet however with the assistance of her fivedaughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from herhusband any satisfactory description of mr. bingley. they attacked himin various wayswith barefaced questions ingenious suppositions anddistant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were atlast obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbourlady lucas. her report was highly favourable. sir william had beendelighted with him. he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremelyagreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assemblywith a large party. nothing could be more delightful to be fond ofdancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very livelyhopes of mr. bingleys heart were entertained.if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfieldsaid mrs. bennet to her husband and all the others equally wellmarried i shall have nothing to wish for.in a few days mr. bingley returned mr. bennets visit and sat aboutten minutes with him in his library. he had entertained hopes of beingadmitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he hadheard much but he saw only the father. the ladies were somewhat morefortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upperwindow that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and alreadyhad mrs. bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to herhousekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all. mr. bingleywas obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unableto accept the honour of their invitation etc. mrs. bennet was quitedisconcerted. she could not imagine what business he could have in townso soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear thathe might be always flying about from one place to another and neversettled at netherfield as he ought to be. lady lucas quieted her fearsa little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to geta large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr. bingleywas to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted theday before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he brought onlysix with him from londonhis five sisters and a cousin. and whenthe party entered the assembly room it consisted of only fivealtogethermr. bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest andanother young man.mr. bingley was goodlooking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasantcountenance and easy unaffected manners. his sisters were fine womenwith an air of decided fashion. his brotherinlaw mr. hurst merelylooked the gentleman but his friend mr. darcy soon drew the attentionof the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien andthe report which was in general circulation within five minutesafter his entrance of his having ten thousand a year. the gentlemenpronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared hewas much handsomer than mr. bingley and he was looked at with greatadmiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgustwhich turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to beproud to be above his company and above being pleased and not allhis large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a mostforbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be comparedwith his friend.mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principalpeople in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dancewas angry that the ball closed so early and talked of givingone himself at netherfield. such amiable qualities must speak forthemselves. what a contrast between him and his friend mr. darcy dancedonly once with mrs. hurst and once with miss bingley declined beingintroduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening inwalking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party.his character was decided. he was the proudest most disagreeable manin the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.amongst the most violent against him was mrs. bennet whose dislike ofhis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by hishaving slighted one of her daughters.elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sitdown for two dances and during part of that time mr. darcy had beenstanding near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and mr.bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friendto join it.come darcy said he i must have you dance. i hate to see youstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner. you had much betterdance.i certainly shall not. you know how i detest it unless i amparticularly acquainted with my partner. at such an assembly as thisit would be insupportable. your sisters are engaged and there is notanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me tostand up with.i would not be so fastidious as you are cried mr. bingley for akingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls inmy life as i have this evening and there are several of them you seeuncommonly pretty.you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr.darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet.oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is oneof her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and idare say very agreeable. do let me ask my partner to introduce you.which do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment atelizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly saidshe is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me i am in nohumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slightedby other men. you had better return to your partner and enjoy hersmiles for you are wasting your time with me.mr. bingley followed his advice. mr. darcy walked off and elizabethremained with no very cordial feelings toward him. she told the storyhowever with great spirit among her friends for she had a livelyplayful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculous.the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. mrs.bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfieldparty. mr. bingley had danced with her twice and she had beendistinguished by his sisters. jane was as much gratified by this asher mother could be though in a quieter way. elizabeth felt janespleasure. mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the mostaccomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had beenfortunate enough never to be without partners which was all that theyhad yet learnt to care for at a ball. they returned therefore in goodspirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which theywere the principal inhabitants. they found mr. bennet still up. witha book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had agood deal of curiosity as to the events of an evening which had raisedsuch splendid expectations. he had rather hoped that his wifes views onthe stranger would be disappointed but he soon found out that he had adifferent story to hear.oh my dear mr. bennet as she entered the room we have had a mostdelightful evening a most excellent ball. i wish you had been there.jane was so admired nothing could be like it. everybody said how wellshe looked and mr. bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced withher twice only think of that my dear he actually danced with hertwice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a secondtime. first of all he asked miss lucas. i was so vexed to see him standup with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobodycan you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was goingdown the dance. so he inquired who she was and got introduced andasked her for the two next. then the two third he danced with miss kingand the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane againand the two sixth with lizzy and the boulangerif he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatientlyhe would not have danced half so much for gods sake say no more ofhis partners. o that he had sprained his ankle in the first danceoh my dear i am quite delighted with him. he is so excessivelyhandsome and his sisters are charming women. i never in my life sawanything more elegant than their dresses. i dare say the lace upon mrs.hursts gownhere she was interrupted again. mr. bennet protested against anydescription of finery. she was therefore obliged to seek another branchof the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and someexaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr. darcy.but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by notsuiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not atall worth pleasing. so high and so conceited that there was no enduringhim he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so verygreat not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there mydear to have given him one of your setdowns. i quite detest the man.chapter when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious inher praise of mr. bingley before expressed to her sister just how verymuch she admired him.he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensiblegoodhumoured lively and i never saw such happy mannersso muchease with such perfect good breedinghe is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man oughtlikewise to be if he possibly can. his character is thereby complete.i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. idid not expect such a compliment.did not you i did for you. but that is one great difference betweenus. compliments always take you by surprise and me never. whatcould be more natural than his asking you again he could not helpseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other womanin the room. no thanks to his gallantry for that. well he certainly isvery agreeable and i give you leave to like him. you have liked many astupider person.dear lizzyoh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general.you never see a fault in anybody. all the world are good and agreeablein your eyes. i never heard you speak ill of a human being in yourlife.i would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone but i always speakwhat i think.i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder. with yourgood sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense ofothers affectation of candour is common enoughone meets with iteverywhere. but to be candid without ostentation or designto take thegood of everybodys character and make it still better and say nothingof the badbelongs to you alone. and so you like this mans sisterstoo do you their manners are not equal to his.certainly notat first. but they are very pleasing women when youconverse with them. miss bingley is to live with her brother and keephis house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charmingneighbour in her.elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour atthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with morequickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sisterand with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself shewas very little disposed to approve them. they were in fact very fineladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in thepower of making themselves agreeable when they chose it but proud andconceited. they were rather handsome had been educated in one of thefirst private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousandpounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and ofassociating with people of rank and were therefore in every respectentitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others. they were ofa respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeplyimpressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and theirown had been acquired by trade.mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundredthousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase anestate but did not live to do it. mr. bingley intended it likewise andsometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with agood house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of thosewho best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend theremainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation topurchase.his sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own butthough he was now only established as a tenant miss bingley was by nomeans unwilling to preside at his tablenor was mrs. hurst who hadmarried a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to considerhis house as her home when it suited her. mr. bingley had not been ofage two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendationto look at netherfield house. he did look at it and into it forhalfanhourwas pleased with the situation and the principalrooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took itimmediately.between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite ofgreat opposition of character. bingley was endeared to darcy by theeasiness openness and ductility of his temper though no dispositioncould offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own henever appeared dissatisfied. on the strength of darcys regard bingleyhad the firmest reliance and of his judgement the highest opinion.in understanding darcy was the superior. bingley was by no meansdeficient but darcy was clever. he was at the same time haughtyreserved and fastidious and his manners though wellbred were notinviting. in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. bingleywas sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continuallygiving offense.the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficientlycharacteristic. bingley had never met with more pleasant people orprettier girls in his life everybody had been most kind and attentiveto him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon feltacquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could notconceive an angel more beautiful. darcy on the contrary had seen acollection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion fornone of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none receivedeither attention or pleasure. miss bennet he acknowledged to be prettybut she smiled too much.mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admiredher and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and onewhom they would not object to know more of. miss bennet was thereforeestablished as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorized by suchcommendation to think of her as he chose.chapter within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennetswere particularly intimate. sir william lucas had been formerly in tradein meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to thehonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. it had given him adisgust to his business and to his residence in a small market townand in quitting them both he had removed with his family to a houseabout a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodgewhere he could think with pleasure of his own importance andunshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to allthe world. for though elated by his rank it did not render himsupercilious on the contrary he was all attention to everybody. bynature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st.jamess had made him courteous.lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be avaluable neighbour to mrs. bennet. they had several children. the eldestof them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven waselizabeths intimate friend.that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk overa ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assemblybrought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate.you began the evening well charlotte said mrs. bennet with civilselfcommand to miss lucas. you were mr. bingleys first choice.yes but he seemed to like his second better.oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice. to besure that did seem as if he admired herindeed i rather believe hedidi heard something about itbut i hardly know whatsomethingabout mr. robinson.perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson did noti mention it to you mr. robinsons asking him how he liked our merytonassemblies and whether he did not think there were a great manypretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and hisanswering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennetbeyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point.upon my word well that is very decided indeedthat does seem asifbut however it may all come to nothing you know.my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza saidcharlotte. mr. darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friendis hepoor elizato be only just tolerable.i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by hisilltreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quitea misfortune to be liked by him. mrs. long told me last night that hesat close to her for halfanhour without once opening his lips.are you quite sure maamis not there a little mistake said jane.i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking to her.ayebecause she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and hecould not help answering her but she said he seemed quite angry atbeing spoke to.miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks muchunless among his intimate acquaintances. with them he is remarkablyagreeable.i do not believe a word of it my dear. if he had been so veryagreeable he would have talked to mrs. long. but i can guess how itwas everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he hadheard somehow that mrs. long does not keep a carriage and had come tothe ball in a hack chaise.i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long said miss lucas but iwish he had danced with eliza.another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with himif i were you.i believe maam i may safely promise you never to dance with him.his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as prideoften does because there is an excuse for it. one cannot wonder that sovery fine a young man with family fortune everything in his favourshould think highly of himself. if i may so express it he has a rightto be proud.that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgivehis pride if he had not mortified mine.pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of herreflections is a very common failing i believe. by all that i haveever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that humannature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of uswho do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of somequality or other real or imaginary. vanity and pride are differentthings though the words are often used synonymously. a person maybe proud without being vain. pride relates more to our opinion ofourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us.if i were as rich as mr. darcy cried a young lucas who came withhis sisters i should not care how proud i was. i would keep a pack offoxhounds and drink a bottle of wine a day.then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs.bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottledirectly.the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that shewould and the argument ended only with the visit.chapter the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield. the visitwas soon returned in due form. miss bennets pleasing manners grew onthe goodwill of mrs. hurst and miss bingley and though the mother wasfound to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking toa wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towardsthe two eldest. by jane this attention was received with the greatestpleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatmentof everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like themthough their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising inall probability from the influence of their brothers admiration. itwas generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her andto her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preferencewhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in away to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that itwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general since janeunited with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and auniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicionsof the impertinent. she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas.it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to imposeon the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to beso very guarded. if a woman conceals her affection with the same skillfrom the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him andit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally inthe dark. there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost everyattachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself. we can allbegin freelya slight preference is natural enough but there arevery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love withoutencouragement. in nine cases out of ten a women had better show moreaffection than she feels. bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but hemay never do more than like her if she does not help him on.but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow. if i canperceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not todiscover it too.remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do.but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to concealit he must find it out.perhaps he must if he sees enough of her. but though bingley and janemeet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as theyalways see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible thatevery moment should be employed in conversing together. jane shouldtherefore make the most of every halfhour in which she can command hisattention. when she is secure of him there will be more leisure forfalling in love as much as she chooses.your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is inquestion but the desire of being well married and if i were determinedto get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it. butthese are not janes feelings she is not acting by design. as yetshe cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of itsreasonableness. she has known him only a fortnight. she danced fourdances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own houseand has since dined with him in company four times. this is not quiteenough to make her understand his character.not as you represent it. had she merely dined with him she mightonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you mustremember that four evenings have also been spent togetherand fourevenings may do a great deal.yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that theyboth like vingtun better than commerce but with respect to any otherleading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded.well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart andif she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good achance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for atwelvemonth. happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. ifthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other orever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in theleast. they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards tohave their share of vexation and it is better to know as little aspossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass yourlife.you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound. you know it is notsound and that you would never act in this way yourself.occupied in observing mr. bingleys attentions to her sister elizabethwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of someinterest in the eyes of his friend. mr. darcy had at first scarcelyallowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at theball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise. but nosooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardlyhad a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendereduncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. tothis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. though he haddetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetryin her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light andpleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not thoseof the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness. ofthis she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who madehimself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enoughto dance with.he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversingwith her himself attended to her conversation with others. his doing sodrew her notice. it was at sir william lucass where a large party wereassembled.what does mr. darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to myconversation with colonel forsterthat is a question which mr. darcy only can answer.but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i seewhat he is about. he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin bybeing impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him.on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to haveany intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention sucha subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it sheturned to him and saiddid you not think mr. darcy that i expressed myself uncommonlywell just now when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball atmerytonwith great energy but it is always a subject which makes a ladyenergetic.you are severe on us.it will be her turn soon to be teased said miss lucas. i am goingto open the instrument eliza and you know what follows.you are a very strange creature by way of a friendalways wanting meto play and sing before anybody and everybody if my vanity had takena musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i wouldreally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit ofhearing the very best performers. on miss lucass persevering howevershe added very well if it must be so it must. and gravely glancingat mr. darcy there is a fine old saying which everybody here is ofcourse familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and ishall keep mine to swell my song.her performance was pleasing though by no means capital. after a songor two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several thatshe would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by hersister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one inthe family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was alwaysimpatient for display.mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given herapplication it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceitedmanner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than shehad reached. elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to withmuch more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at theend of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude byscotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters whowith some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly indancing at one end of the room.mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode ofpassing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was toomuch engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas washis neighbour till sir william thus beganwhat a charming amusement for young people this is mr. darcy thereis nothing like dancing after all. i consider it as one of the firstrefinements of polished society.certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongstthe less polished societies of the world. every savage can dance.sir william only smiled. your friend performs delightfully hecontinued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubtnot that you are an adept in the science yourself mr. darcy.you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir.yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. doyou often dance at st. jamessnever sir.do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the placeit is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it.you have a house in town i concludemr. darcy bowed.i had once had some thought of fixing in town myselffor i am fondof superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air oflondon would agree with lady lucas.he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposedto make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he wasstruck with the action of doing a very gallant thing and called out tohermy dear miss eliza why are you not dancing mr. darcy you must allowme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. youcannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you.and taking her hand he would have given it to mr. darcy who thoughextremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantlydrew back and said with some discomposure to sir williamindeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing. i entreat younot to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner.mr. darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour ofher hand but in vain. elizabeth was determined nor did sir william atall shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to denyme the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes theamusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige usfor one halfhour.mr. darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling.he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss elizawe cannot wonder at his complaisancefor who would object to such apartnerelizabeth looked archly and turned away. her resistance had notinjured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with somecomplacency when thus accosted by miss bingleyi can guess the subject of your reverie.i should imagine not.you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many eveningsin this mannerin such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion.i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noisethenothingness and yet the selfimportance of all those people what wouldi give to hear your strictures on themyour conjecture is totally wrong i assure you. my mind was moreagreeably engaged. i have been meditating on the very great pleasurewhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired hewould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.mr. darcy replied with great intrepiditymiss elizabeth bennet.miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley. i am all astonishment.how long has she been such a favouriteand pray when am i to wish youjoythat is exactly the question which i expected you to ask. a ladysimagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from loveto matrimony in a moment. i knew you would be wishing me joy.nay if you are serious about it i shall consider the matter isabsolutely settled. you will be having a charming motherinlaw indeedand of course she will always be at pemberley with you.he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose toentertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced herthat all was safe her wit flowed long.chapter mr. bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of twothousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailedin default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mothersfortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supplythe deficiency of his. her father had been an attorney in meryton andhad left her four thousand pounds.she had a sister married to a mr. phillips who had been a clerk totheir father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled inlondon in a respectable line of trade.the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a mostconvenient distance for the young ladies who were usually temptedthither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt andto a milliners shop just over the way. the two youngest of the familycatherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentionstheir minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothingbetter offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morninghours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of newsthe country in general might be they always contrived to learn somefrom their aunt. at present indeed they were well supplied both withnews and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in theneighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was theheadquarters.their visits to mrs. phillips were now productive of the mostinteresting intelligence. every day added something to their knowledgeof the officers names and connections. their lodgings were not long asecret and at length they began to know the officers themselves. mr.phillips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a store offelicity unknown before. they could talk of nothing but officers andmr. bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animationto their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to theregimentals of an ensign.after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr.bennet coolly observedfrom all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be twoof the silliest girls in the country. i have suspected it some time buti am now convinced.catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfectindifference continued to express her admiration of captain carterand her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going thenext morning to london.i am astonished my dear said mrs. bennet that you should be soready to think your own children silly. if i wished to think slightinglyof anybodys children it should not be of my own however.if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it.yesbut as it happens they are all of them very clever.this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree. ihad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i mustso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonlyfoolish.my dear mr. bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense oftheir father and mother. when they get to our age i dare say they willnot think about officers any more than we do. i remember the time wheni liked a red coat myself very welland indeed so i do still at myheart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a yearshould want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thoughtcolonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams inhis regimentals.mamma cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captaincarter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they firstcame she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library.mrs. bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman witha note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waitedfor an answer. mrs. bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she waseagerly calling out while her daughter readwell jane who is it from what is it about what does he say welljane make haste and tell us make haste my love.it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud.my dear friendif you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and mewe shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our livesfor a whole days teteatete between two women can never end without aquarrel. come as soon as you can on receipt of this. my brother and thegentlemen are to dine with the officers.yours evercaroline bingleywith the officers cried lydia. i wonder my aunt did not tell us ofthat.dining out said mrs. bennet that is very unlucky.can i have the carriage said jane.no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely torain and then you must stay all night.that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure thatthey would not offer to send her home.oh but the gentlemen will have mr. bingleys chaise to go to merytonand the hursts have no horses to theirs.i had much rather go in the coach.but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure. they arewanted in the farm mr. bennet are they notthey are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them.but if you have got them today said elizabeth my mothers purposewill be answered.she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horseswere engaged. jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and hermother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of abad day. her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long beforeit rained hard. her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother wasdelighted. the rain continued the whole evening without intermissionjane certainly could not come back.this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs. bennet more thanonce as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. till thenext morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of hercontrivance. breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfieldbrought the following note for elizabethmy dearest lizzyi find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to beimputed to my getting wet through yesterday. my kind friends will nothear of my returning till i am better. they insist also on my seeing mr.jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having beento meand excepting a sore throat and headache there is not much thematter with me.yours etc.well my dear said mr. bennet when elizabeth had read the notealoud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illnessif sheshould die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit ofmr. bingley and under your orders.oh i am not afraid of her dying. people do not die of little triflingcolds. she will be taken good care of. as long as she stays there it isall very well. i would go and see her if i could have the carriage.elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her thoughthe carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walkingwas her only alternative. she declared her resolution.how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such athing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you getthere.i shall be very fit to see janewhich is all i want.is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for thehorsesno indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk. the distance is nothingwhen one has a motive only three miles. i shall be back by dinner.i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but everyimpulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinionexertion should always be in proportion to what is required.we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia.elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set offtogether.if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we maysee something of captain carter before he goes.in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of oneof the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossingfield after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springingover puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at lastwithin view of the house with weary ankles dirty stockings and a faceglowing with the warmth of exercise.she was shown into the breakfastparlour where all but jane wereassembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in suchdirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs. hurst andmiss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contemptfor it. she was received however very politely by them and in theirbrothers manners there was something better than politeness therewas good humour and kindness. mr. darcy said very little and mr.hurst nothing at all. the former was divided between admiration of thebrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt asto the occasions justifying her coming so far alone. the latter wasthinking only of his breakfast.her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. missbennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and notwell enough to leave her room. elizabeth was glad to be taken to herimmediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of givingalarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longedfor such a visit was delighted at her entrance. she was not equalhowever to much conversation and when miss bingley left themtogether could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for theextraordinary kindness she was treated with. elizabeth silently attendedher.when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabethbegan to like them herself when she saw how much affection andsolicitude they showed for jane. the apothecary came and havingexamined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caughta violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of itadvised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts. the advicewas followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her headached acutely. elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor werethe other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had infact nothing to do elsewhere.when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and veryunwillingly said so. miss bingley offered her the carriage and she onlywanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concernin parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offerof the chaise to an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present.elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched tolongbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supplyof clothes.chapter at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at halfpast sixelizabeth was summoned to dinner. to the civil inquiries which thenpoured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing themuch superior solicitude of mr. bingleys she could not make a veryfavourable answer. jane was by no means better. the sisters on hearingthis repeated three or four times how much they were grieved howshocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they dislikedbeing ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and theirindifference towards jane when not immediately before them restoredelizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she couldregard with any complacency. his anxiety for jane was evident and hisattentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feelingherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by theothers. she had very little notice from any but him. miss bingley wasengrossed by mr. darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr.hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only toeat drink and play at cards who when he found her to prefer a plaindish to a ragout had nothing to say to her.when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingleybegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. her manners werepronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinenceshe had no conversation no style no beauty. mrs. hurst thought thesame and addedshe has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellentwalker. i shall never forget her appearance this morning. she reallylooked almost wild.she did indeed louisa. i could hardly keep my countenance. verynonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about thecountry because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowsyyes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deepin mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down tohide it not doing its office.your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this wasall lost upon me. i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkablywell when she came into the room this morning. her dirty petticoat quiteescaped my notice.you observed it mr. darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i aminclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make suchan exhibition.certainly not.to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it isabove her ankles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean byit it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independencea most countrytown indifference to decorum.it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing saidbingley.i am afraid mr. darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper thatthis adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise. ashort pause followed this speech and mrs. hurst began againi have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet she is really a verysweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled. but withsuch a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there isno chance of it.i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney onmeryton.yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside.that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily.if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley itwould not make them one jot less agreeable.but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of anyconsideration in the world replied darcy.to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it theirhearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense oftheir dear friends vulgar relations.with a renewal of tenderness however they returned to her room onleaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee.she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all tilllate in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep andwhen it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should godownstairs herself. on entering the drawingroom she found the wholeparty at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspectingthem to be playing high she declined it and making her sister theexcuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could staybelow with a book. mr. hurst looked at her with astonishment.do you prefer reading to cards said he that is rather singular.miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards. she is a greatreader and has no pleasure in anything else.i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i amnot a great reader and i have pleasure in many things.in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley andi hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards thetable where a few books were lying. he immediately offered to fetch herothersall that his library afforded.and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my owncredit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have morethan i ever looked into.elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with thosein the room.i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have leftso small a collection of books. what a delightful library you have atpemberley mr. darcyit ought to be good he replied it has been the work of manygenerations.and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buyingbooks.i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days asthese.neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties ofthat noble place. charles when you build your house i wish it may behalf as delightful as pemberley.i wish it may.but i would really advise you to make your purchase in thatneighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model. there is not afiner county in england than derbyshire.with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it.i am talking of possibilities charles.upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to getpemberley by purchase than by imitation.elizabeth was so much caught with what passed as to leave her verylittle attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drewnear the cardtable and stationed herself between mr. bingley and hiseldest sister to observe the game.is miss darcy much grown since the spring said miss bingley willshe be as tall as i ami think she will. she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height orrather taller.how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted meso much. such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplishedfor her age her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patienceto be so very accomplished as they all are.all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you meanyes all of them i think. they all paint tables cover screens andnet purses. i scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this and i am surei never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without beinginformed that she was very accomplished.your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy hastoo much truth. the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it nootherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. but i am veryfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. icannot boast of knowing more than halfadozen in the whole range of myacquaintance that are really accomplished.nor i i am sure said miss bingley.then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in youridea of an accomplished woman.yes i do comprehend a great deal in it.oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be reallyesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually metwith. a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawingdancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besidesall this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner ofwalking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the wordwill be but halfdeserved.all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she mustyet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind byextensive reading.i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women.i rather wonder now at your knowing any.are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of allthisi never saw such a woman. i never saw such capacity and taste andapplication and elegance as you describe united.mrs. hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of herimplied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women whoanswered this description when mr. hurst called them to order withbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. as allconversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left theroom.elizabeth bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on heris one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to theother sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say itsucceeds. but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art.undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressedthere is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescendto employ for captivation. whatever bears affinity to cunning isdespicable.miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as tocontinue the subject.elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse andthat she could not leave her. bingley urged mr. jones being sent forimmediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice couldbe of any service recommended an express to town for one of the mosteminent physicians. this she would not hear of but she was not sounwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settledthat mr. jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennetwere not decidedly better. bingley was quite uncomfortable his sistersdeclared that they were miserable. they solaced their wretchednesshowever by duets after supper while he could find no better reliefto his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that everyattention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.chapter elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in themorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to theinquiries which she very early received from mr. bingley by a housemaidand some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on hissisters. in spite of this amendment however she requested to have anote sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form herown judgement of her situation. the note was immediately dispatched andits contents as quickly complied with. mrs. bennet accompanied by hertwo youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast.had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs. bennet would have beenvery miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness wasnot alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as herrestoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield. shewould not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carriedhome neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time thinkit at all advisable. after sitting a little while with jane on missbingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughter allattended her into the breakfast parlour. bingley met them with hopesthat mrs. bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected.indeed i have sir was her answer. she is a great deal too ill to bemoved. mr. jones says we must not think of moving her. we must trespassa little longer on your kindness.removed cried bingley. it must not be thought of. my sister i amsure will not hear of her removal.you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civilitythat miss bennet will receive every possible attention while sheremains with us.mrs. bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do notknow what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffersa vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which isalways the way with her for she has without exception the sweetesttemper i have ever met with. i often tell my other girls they arenothing to her. you have a sweet room here mr. bingley and acharming prospect over the gravel walk. i do not know a place in thecountry that is equal to netherfield. you will not think of quitting itin a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease.whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if ishould resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in fiveminutes. at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here.that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth.you begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards her.oh yesi understand you perfectly.i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seenthrough i am afraid is pitiful.that is as it happens. it does not follow that a deep intricatecharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on inthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were astudier of character. it must be an amusing study.yes but intricate characters are the most amusing. they have atleast that advantage.the country said darcy can in general supply but a few subjects forsuch a study. in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined andunvarying society.but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to beobserved in them for ever.yes indeed cried mrs. bennet offended by his manner of mentioninga country neighbourhood. i assure you there is quite as much of thatgoing on in the country as in town.everybody was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a momentturned silently away. mrs. bennet who fancied she had gained a completevictory over him continued her triumph.i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country formy part except the shops and public places. the country is a vast dealpleasanter is it not mr. bingleywhen i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave itand when i am in town it is pretty much the same. they have each theiradvantages and i can be equally happy in either.ayethat is because you have the right disposition. but thatgentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothingat all.indeed mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for hermother. you quite mistook mr. darcy. he only meant that there was notsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the townwhich you must acknowledge to be true.certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meetingwith many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are fewneighbourhoods larger. i know we dine with fourandtwenty families.nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep hiscountenance. his sister was less delicate and directed her eyes towardsmr. darcy with a very expressive smile. elizabeth for the sake ofsaying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her ifcharlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away.yes she called yesterday with her father. what an agreeable man sirwilliam is mr. bingley is not he so much the man of fashion sogenteel and easy he had always something to say to everybody. thatis my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves veryimportant and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.did charlotte dine with youno she would go home. i fancy she was wanted about the mincepies. formy part mr. bingley i always keep servants that can do their own workmy daughters are brought up very differently. but everybody is tojudge for themselves and the lucases are a very good sort of girlsi assure you. it is a pity they are not handsome not that i thinkcharlotte so very plainbut then she is our particular friend.she seems a very pleasant young woman.oh dear yes but you must own she is very plain. lady lucas herselfhas often said so and envied me janes beauty. i do not like to boastof my own child but to be sure janeone does not often see anybodybetter looking. it is what everybody says. i do not trust my ownpartiality. when she was only fifteen there was a man at my brothergardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw wassure he would make her an offer before we came away. but however hedid not. perhaps he thought her too young. however he wrote some verseson her and very pretty they were.and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently. there hasbeen many a one i fancy overcome in the same way. i wonder who firstdiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away lovei have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy.of a fine stout healthy love it may. everything nourishes what isstrong already. but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination iam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabethtremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. she longed tospeak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs.bennet began repeating her thanks to mr. bingley for his kindness tojane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy. mr. bingley wasunaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to becivil also and say what the occasion required. she performed her partindeed without much graciousness but mrs. bennet was satisfied andsoon afterwards ordered her carriage. upon this signal the youngest ofher daughters put herself forward. the two girls had been whispering toeach other during the whole visit and the result of it was that theyoungest should tax mr. bingley with having promised on his first cominginto the country to give a ball at netherfield.lydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine complexionand goodhumoured countenance a favourite with her mother whoseaffection had brought her into public at an early age. she had highanimal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which theattention of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her owneasy manners recommended her had increased into assurance. she was veryequal therefore to address mr. bingley on the subject of the ball andabruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the mostshameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. his answer to thissudden attack was delightful to their mothers eari am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and whenyour sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day ofthe ball. but you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.lydia declared herself satisfied. oh yesit would be much better towait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carterwould be at meryton again. and when you have given your ball sheadded i shall insist on their giving one also. i shall tell colonelforster it will be quite a shame if he does not.mrs. bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returnedinstantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to theremarks of the two ladies and mr. darcy the latter of whom howevercould not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite ofall miss bingleys witticisms on fine eyes.chapter the day passed much as the day before had done. mrs. hurst and missbingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid whocontinued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joinedtheir party in the drawingroom. the lootable however did not appear.mr. darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watchingthe progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention bymessages to his sister. mr. hurst and mr. bingley were at piquet andmrs. hurst was observing their game.elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused inattending to what passed between darcy and his companion. the perpetualcommendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evennessof his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcernwith which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and wasexactly in union with her opinion of each.how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letterhe made no answer.you write uncommonly fast.you are mistaken. i write rather slowly.how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of ayear letters of business too how odious i should think themit is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of yours.pray tell your sister that i long to see her.i have already told her so once by your desire.i am afraid you do not like your pen. let me mend it for you. i mendpens remarkably well.thank youbut i always mend my own.how can you contrive to write so evenhe was silent.tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harpand pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautifullittle design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to missgrantleys.will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again atpresent i have not room to do them justice.oh it is of no consequence. i shall see her in january. but do youalways write such charming long letters to her mr. darcythey are generally long but whether always charming it is not for meto determine.it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter withease cannot write ill.that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried herbrother because he does not write with ease. he studies too much forwords of four syllables. do not you darcymy style of writing is very different from yours.oh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless wayimaginable. he leaves out half his words and blots the rest.my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express themby whichmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.your humility mr. bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof.nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance ofhumility. it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes anindirect boast.and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modestythe indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects inwriting because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity ofthought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable youthink at least highly interesting. the power of doing anything withquickness is always prized much by the possessor and often without anyattention to the imperfection of the performance. when you told mrs.bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting netherfieldyou should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort ofpanegyric of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so verylaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary businessundone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone elsenay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all thefoolish things that were said in the morning. and yet upon my honouri believe what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at thismoment. at least therefore i did not assume the character of needlessprecipitance merely to show off before the ladies.i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced thatyou would be gone with such celerity. your conduct would be quite asdependent on chance as that of any man i know and if as you weremounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had betterstay till next week you would probably do it you would probably notgoand at another word might stay a month.you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr. bingley didnot do justice to his own disposition. you have shown him off now muchmore than he did himself.i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what myfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. but i amafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no meansintend for he would certainly think better of me if under such acircumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as icould.would mr. darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentionsas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to itupon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak forhimself.you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call minebut which i have never acknowledged. allowing the case however tostand according to your representation you must remember miss bennetthat the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house andthe delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offeringone argument in favour of its propriety.to yield readilyeasilyto the persuasion of a friend is no meritwith you.to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding ofeither.you appear to me mr. darcy to allow nothing for the influence offriendship and affection. a regard for the requester would often makeone readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reasonone into it. i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you havesupposed about mr. bingley. we may as well wait perhaps till thecircumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviourthereupon. but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friendwhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of novery great moment should you think ill of that person for complyingwith the desire without waiting to be argued into itwill it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject toarrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is toappertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsistingbetween the partiesby all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars notforgetting their comparative height and size for that will have moreweight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of. i assureyou that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison withmyself i should not pay him half so much deference. i declare i do notknow a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions and inparticular places at his own house especially and of a sunday eveningwhen he has nothing to do.mr. darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he wasrather offended and therefore checked her laugh. miss bingley warmlyresented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with herbrother for talking such nonsense.i see your design bingley said his friend. you dislike an argumentand want to silence this.perhaps i do. arguments are too much like disputes. if you and missbennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be verythankful and then you may say whatever you like of me.what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr.darcy had much better finish his letter.mr. darcy took her advice and did finish his letter.when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabethfor an indulgence of some music. miss bingley moved with some alacrityto the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would leadthe way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived sheseated herself.mrs. hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employedelizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some musicbooksthat lay on the instrument how frequently mr. darcys eyes were fixedon her. she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object ofadmiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at herbecause he disliked her was still more strange. she could only imaginehowever at last that she drew his notice because there was somethingmore wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than inany other person present. the supposition did not pain her. she likedhim too little to care for his approbation.after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm bya lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr. darcy drawing nearelizabeth said to herdo not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such anopportunity of dancing a reelshe smiled but made no answer. he repeated the question with somesurprise at her silence.oh said she i heard you before but i could not immediatelydetermine what to say in reply. you wanted me i know to say yesthat you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i alwaysdelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person oftheir premeditated contempt. i have therefore made up my mind to tellyou that i do not want to dance a reel at alland now despise me ifyou dare.indeed i do not dare.elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at hisgallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in hermanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcyhad never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. he reallybelieved that were it not for the inferiority of her connections heshould be in some danger.miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her greatanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received someassistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth.she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking oftheir supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance.i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubberythe next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when thisdesirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongueand if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running afterofficers. and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour tocheck that little something bordering on conceit and impertinencewhich your lady possesses.have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicityoh yes. do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt phillips be placedin the gallery at pemberley. put them next to your greatuncle thejudge. they are in the same profession you know only in differentlines. as for your elizabeths picture you must not have it taken forwhat painter could do justice to those beautiful eyesit would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but theircolour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might becopied.at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs. hurst andelizabeth herself.i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in someconfusion lest they had been overheard.you used us abominably ill answered mrs. hurst running away withouttelling us that you were coming out.then taking the disengaged arm of mr. darcy she left elizabeth to walkby herself. the path just admitted three. mr. darcy felt their rudenessand immediately saidthis walk is not wide enough for our party. we had better go into theavenue.but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with themlaughingly answeredno no stay where you are. you are charmingly grouped and appearto uncommon advantage. the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting afourth. goodbye.she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope ofbeing at home again in a day or two. jane was already so much recoveredas to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.chapter when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to hersister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into thedrawingroom where she was welcomed by her two friends with manyprofessions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeableas they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.their powers of conversation were considerable. they could describe anentertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laughat their acquaintance with spirit.but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first objectmiss bingleys eyes were instantly turned toward darcy and she hadsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps. he addressedhimself to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr. hurst alsomade her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffusenessand warmth remained for bingleys salutation. he was full of joy andattention. the first halfhour was spent in piling up the fire lest sheshould suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desireto the other side of the fireplace that she might be further fromthe door. he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to anyoneelse. elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with greatdelight.when tea was over mr. hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of thecardtablebut in vain. she had obtained private intelligence that mr.darcy did not wish for cards and mr. hurst soon found even his openpetition rejected. she assured him that no one intended to play andthe silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. mr.hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of thesofas and go to sleep. darcy took up a book miss bingley did the sameand mrs. hurst principally occupied in playing with her braceletsand rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with missbennet.miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr.darcys progress through his book as in reading her own and shewas perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page. shecould not win him however to any conversation he merely answered herquestion and read on. at length quite exhausted by the attempt to beamused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was thesecond volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasantit is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is noenjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of anything than of abook when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have notan excellent library.no one made any reply. she then yawned again threw aside her book andcast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement when hearingher brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenlytowards him and saidby the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance atnetherfield i would advise you before you determine on it to consultthe wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there arenot some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than apleasure.if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if hechooses before it beginsbut as for the ball it is quite a settledthing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall sendround my cards.i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they werecarried on in a different manner but there is something insufferablytedious in the usual process of such a meeting. it would surely be muchmore rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order ofthe day.much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not benear so much like a ball.miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards she got up and walkedabout the room. her figure was elegant and she walked well butdarcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious. inthe desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more andturning to elizabeth saidmiss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take aturn about the room. i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting solong in one attitude.elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately. miss bingleysucceeded no less in the real object of her civility mr. darcy lookedup. he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter aselizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book. he wasdirectly invited to join their party but he declined it observing thathe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and downthe room together with either of which motives his joining them wouldinterfere. what could he mean she was dying to know what could be hismeaningand asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand himnot at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severeon us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothingabout it.miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr. darcy inanything and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of histwo motives.i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soonas she allowed him to speak. you either choose this method of passingthe evening because you are in each others confidence and have secretaffairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figuresappear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i would becompletely in your way and if the second i can admire you much betteras i sit by the fire.oh shocking cried miss bingley. i never heard anything soabominable. how shall we punish him for such a speechnothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth. wecan all plague and punish one another. tease himlaugh at him. intimateas you are you must know how it is to be done.but upon my honour i do not. i do assure you that my intimacy hasnot yet taught me that. tease calmness of manner and presence ofmind no nofeel he may defy us there. and as to laughter we willnot expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without asubject. mr. darcy may hug himself.mr. darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth. that is anuncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it wouldbe a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances. i dearly love alaugh.miss bingley said he has given me more credit than can be.the wisest and the best of mennay the wisest and best of theiractionsmay be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object inlife is a joke.certainly replied elizabeththere are such people but i hope iam not one of them. i hope i never ridicule what is wise and good.follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i ownand i laugh at them whenever i can. but these i suppose are preciselywhat you are without.perhaps that is not possible for anyone. but it has been the studyof my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strongunderstanding to ridicule.such as vanity and pride.yes vanity is a weakness indeed. but pridewhere there is a realsuperiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation.elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.your examination of mr. darcy is over i presume said miss bingleyand pray what is the resulti am perfectly convinced by it that mr. darcy has no defect. he owns ithimself without disguise.no said darcy i have made no such pretension. i have faults enoughbut they are not i hope of understanding. my temper i dare not vouchfor. it is i believe too little yieldingcertainly too little for theconvenience of the world. i cannot forget the follies and vices of otherso soon as i ought nor their offenses against myself. my feelingsare not puffed about with every attempt to move them. my temperwould perhaps be called resentful. my good opinion once lost is lostforever.that is a failing indeed cried elizabeth. implacable resentmentis a shade in a character. but you have chosen your fault well. ireally cannot laugh at it. you are safe from me.there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particularevila natural defect which not even the best education can overcome.and your defect is to hate everybody.and yours he replied with a smile is willfully to misunderstandthem.do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of aconversation in which she had no share. louisa you will not mind mywaking mr. hursther sister had not the smallest objection and the pianoforte wasopened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry forit. he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention.chapter in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote thenext morning to their mother to beg that the carriage might be sent forthem in the course of the day. but mrs. bennet who had calculated onher daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday whichwould exactly finish janes week could not bring herself to receivethem with pleasure before. her answer therefore was not propitious atleast not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home. mrs.bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriagebefore tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr. bingleyand his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare themvery well. against staying longer however elizabeth was positivelyresolvednor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on thecontrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly longshe urged jane to borrow mr. bingleys carriage immediately and atlength it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfieldthat morning should be mentioned and the request made.the communication excited many professions of concern and enough wassaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to workon jane and till the morrow their going was deferred. miss bingley wasthen sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislikeof one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go sosoon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not besafe for herthat she was not enough recovered but jane was firm whereshe felt herself to be right.to mr. darcy it was welcome intelligenceelizabeth had been atnetherfield long enough. she attracted him more than he likedand missbingley was uncivil to her and more teasing than usual to himself.he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admirationshould now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hopeof influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had beensuggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weightin confirming or crushing it. steady to his purpose he scarcely spoketen words to her through the whole of saturday and though they wereat one time left by themselves for halfanhour he adhered mostconscientiously to his book and would not even look at her.on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almostall took place. miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at lastvery rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they partedafter assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give herto see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her mosttenderly she even shook hands with the former. elizabeth took leave ofthe whole party in the liveliest of spirits.they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. mrs. bennetwondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so muchtrouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again. but theirfather though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was reallyglad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle. theevening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much ofits animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane andelizabeth.they found mary as usual deep in the study of thoroughbass and humannature and had some extracts to admire and some new observations ofthreadbare morality to listen to. catherine and lydia had informationfor them of a different sort. much had been done and much had been saidin the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officershad dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and ithad actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married.chapter i hope my dear said mr. bennet to his wife as they were atbreakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner todaybecause i have reason to expect an addition to our family party.who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sureunless charlotte lucas should happen to call inand i hope my dinnersare good enough for her. i do not believe she often sees such at home.the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger.mrs. bennets eyes sparkled. a gentleman and a stranger it is mr.bingley i am sure well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr.bingley. butgood lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to begot today. lydia my love ring the belli must speak to hill thismoment.it is not mr. bingley said her husband it is a person whom inever saw in the whole course of my life.this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of beingeagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explainedabout a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight agoi answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiringearly attention. it is from my cousin mr. collins who when i am deadmay turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.oh my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned.pray do not talk of that odious man. i do think it is the hardest thingin the world that your estate should be entailed away from your ownchildren and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long agoto do something or other about it.jane and elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. theyhad often attempted to do it before but it was a subject on whichmrs. bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to railbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family offive daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr. bennet andnothing can clear mr. collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn.but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a littlesoftened by his manner of expressing himself.no that i am sure i shall not and i think it is very impertinent ofhim to write to you at all and very hypocritical. i hate such falsefriends. why could he not keep on quarreling with you as his father didbefore himwhy indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on thathead as you will hear.hunsford near westerham kent th october.dear sirthe disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honouredfather always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had themisfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach butfor some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it mightseem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyonewith whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.there mrs.bennet.my mind however is now made up on the subject for havingreceived ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to bedistinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine debourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence haspreferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall bemy earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards herladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies whichare instituted by the church of england. as a clergyman moreover ifeel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace inall families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds iflatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable andthat the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estatewill be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject theoffered olivebranch. i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being themeans of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise forit as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possibleamendsbut of this hereafter. if you should have no objection toreceive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waitingon you and your family monday november th by four oclock andshall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday seennightfollowing which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherineis far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday providedthat some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.iremain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady anddaughters your wellwisher and friendwilliam collinsat four oclock therefore we may expect this peacemaking gentlemansaid mr. bennet as he folded up the letter. he seems to be a mostconscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not willprove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be soindulgent as to let him come to us again.there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and ifhe is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person todiscourage him.though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can meanto make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to hiscredit.elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for ladycatherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and buryinghis parishioners whenever it were required.he must be an oddity i think said she. i cannot make himout.there is something very pompous in his style.and what can hemean by apologising for being next in the entailwe cannot suppose hewould help it if he could.could he be a sensible man sirno my dear i think not. i have great hopes of finding him quite thereverse. there is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in hisletter which promises well. i am impatient to see him.in point of composition said mary the letter does not seemdefective. the idea of the olivebranch perhaps is not wholly new yet ithink it is well expressed.to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in anydegree interesting. it was next to impossible that their cousin shouldcome in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they hadreceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. as fortheir mother mr. collinss letter had done away much of her illwilland she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure whichastonished her husband and daughters.mr. collins was punctual to his time and was received with greatpoliteness by the whole family. mr. bennet indeed said little but theladies were ready enough to talk and mr. collins seemed neither inneed of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself. he was atall heavylooking young man of fiveandtwenty. his air was grave andstately and his manners were very formal. he had not been long seatedbefore he complimented mrs. bennet on having so fine a family ofdaughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in thisinstance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he didnot doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. thisgallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrs.bennet who quarreled with no compliments answered most readily.you are very kind i am sure and i wish with all my heart it mayprove so for else they will be destitute enough. things are settled sooddly.you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate.ah sir i do indeed. it is a grievous affair to my poor girls youmust confess. not that i mean to find fault with you for such thingsi know are all chance in this world. there is no knowing how estateswill go when once they come to be entailed.i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins andcould say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearingforward and precipitate. but i can assure the young ladies that i comeprepared to admire them. at present i will not say more but perhapswhen we are better acquaintedhe was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on eachother. they were not the only objects of mr. collinss admiration. thehall the diningroom and all its furniture were examined and praisedand his commendation of everything would have touched mrs. bennetsheart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as hisown future property. the dinner too in its turn was highly admired andhe begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of itscooking was owing. but he was set right there by mrs. bennet whoassured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep agood cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. hebegged pardon for having displeased her. in a softened tone she declaredherself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about aquarter of an hour.chapter during dinner mr. bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servantswere withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with hisguest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him toshine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. ladycatherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration forhis comfort appeared very remarkable. mr. bennet could not have chosenbetter. mr. collins was eloquent in her praise. the subject elevated himto more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspecthe protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour ina person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himselfexperienced from lady catherine. she had been graciously pleased toapprove of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour ofpreaching before her. she had also asked him twice to dine at rosingsand had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool ofquadrille in the evening. lady catherine was reckoned proud by manypeople he knew but he had never seen anything but affability in her.she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman shemade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of theneighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week ortwo to visit his relations. she had even condescended to advise him tomarry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and hadonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectlyapproved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafedto suggest some herselfsome shelves in the closet upstairs.that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs. bennet andi dare say she is a very agreeable woman. it is a pity that great ladiesin general are not more like her. does she live near you sirthe garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lanefrom rosings park her ladyships residence.i think you said she was a widow sir has she any familyshe has only one daughter the heiress of rosings and of veryextensive property.ah said mrs. bennet shaking her head then she is better off thanmany girls. and what sort of young lady is she is she handsomeshe is a most charming young lady indeed. lady catherine herself saysthat in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to thehandsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marksthe young lady of distinguished birth. she is unfortunately of a sicklyconstitution which has prevented her from making that progress in manyaccomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of as i aminformed by the lady who superintended her education and who stillresides with them. but she is perfectly amiable and often condescendsto drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies atcourt.her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in townand by that means as i told lady catherine one day has deprived thebritish court of its brightest ornaments. her ladyship seemed pleasedwith the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion tooffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptableto ladies. i have more than once observed to lady catherine thather charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the mostelevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned byher. these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship andit is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound topay.you judge very properly said mr. bennet and it is happy for youthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. may i askwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of themoment or are the result of previous studythey arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though isometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegantcompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish togive them as unstudied an air as possible.mr. bennets expectations were fully answered. his cousin was as absurdas he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoymentmaintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenanceand except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partnerin his pleasure.by teatime however the dose had been enough and mr. bennet was gladto take his guest into the drawingroom again and when tea was overglad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. mr. collins readilyassented and a book was produced but on beholding it for everythingannounced it to be from a circulating library he started back andbegging pardon protested that he never read novels. kitty stared athim and lydia exclaimed. other books were produced and after somedeliberation he chose fordyces sermons. lydia gaped as he opened thevolume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read threepages she interrupted him withdo you know mamma that my uncle phillips talks of turning awayrichard and if he does colonel forster will hire him. my aunt told meso herself on saturday. i shall walk to meryton tomorrow to hear moreabout it and to ask when mr. denny comes back from town.lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr.collins much offended laid aside his book and saidi have often observed how little young ladies are interested by booksof a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit. it amazesme i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous tothem as instruction. but i will no longer importune my young cousin.then turning to mr. bennet he offered himself as his antagonist atbackgammon. mr. bennet accepted the challenge observing that he actedvery wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.mrs. bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydiasinterruption and promised that it should not occur again if he wouldresume his book but mr. collins after assuring them that he bore hisyoung cousin no illwill and should never resent her behaviour as anyaffront seated himself at another table with mr. bennet and preparedfor backgammon.chapter mr. collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature hadbeen but little assisted by education or society the greatest partof his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate andmiserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities hehad merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any usefulacquaintance. the subjection in which his father had brought him up hadgiven him originally great humility of manner but it was now agood deal counteracted by the selfconceit of a weak head living inretirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpectedprosperity. a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine debourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect whichhe felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patronessmingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as aclergyman and his right as a rector made him altogether a mixture ofpride and obsequiousness selfimportance and humility.having now a good house and a very sufficient income he intended tomarry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he hada wife in view as he meant to choose one of the daughters if he foundthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.this was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathersestate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility andsuitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his ownpart.his plan did not vary on seeing them. miss bennets lovely faceconfirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of whatwas due to seniority and for the first evening she was his settledchoice. the next morning however made an alteration for in aquarter of an hours teteatete with mrs. bennet before breakfast aconversation beginning with his parsonagehouse and leading naturallyto the avowal of his hopes that a mistress might be found for it atlongbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and generalencouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on. as toher younger daughters she could not take upon her to sayshe couldnot positively answerbut she did not know of any prepossession hereldest daughter she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on herto hint was likely to be very soon engaged.mr. collins had only to change from jane to elizabethand it was soondonedone while mrs. bennet was stirring the fire. elizabeth equallynext to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course.mrs. bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon havetwo daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak ofthe day before was now high in her good graces.lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sisterexcept mary agreed to go with her and mr. collins was to attend themat the request of mr. bennet who was most anxious to get rid of himand have his library to himself for thither mr. collins had followedhim after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged withone of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr.bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford. suchdoings discomposed mr. bennet exceedingly. in his library he had beenalways sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he toldelizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of thehouse he was used to be free from them there his civility thereforewas most prompt in inviting mr. collins to join his daughters in theirwalk and mr. collins being in fact much better fitted for a walkerthan a reader was extremely pleased to close his large book and go.in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of hiscousins their time passed till they entered meryton. the attention ofthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. their eyes wereimmediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers andnothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin ina shop window could recall them.but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whomthey had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walkingwith another officer on the other side of the way. the officer wasthe very mr. denny concerning whose return from london lydia cameto inquire and he bowed as they passed. all were struck with thestrangers air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydiadetermined if possible to find out led the way across the street underpretense of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunatelyhad just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back hadreached the same spot. mr. denny addressed them directly and entreatedpermission to introduce his friend mr. wickham who had returned withhim the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted acommission in their corps. this was exactly as it should be for theyoung man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part ofbeauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address.the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readinessof conversationa readiness at the same time perfectly correct andunassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking togethervery agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcyand bingley were seen riding down the street. on distinguishing theladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them andbegan the usual civilities. bingley was the principal spokesman andmiss bennet the principal object. he was then he said on his way tolongbourn on purpose to inquire after her. mr. darcy corroboratedit with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyeson elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of thestranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as theylooked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.both changed colour one looked white the other red. mr. wickhamafter a few moments touched his hata salutation which mr. darcy justdeigned to return. what could be the meaning of it it was impossible toimagine it was impossible not to long to know.in another minute mr. bingley but without seeming to have noticed whatpassed took leave and rode on with his friend.mr. denny and mr. wickham walked with the young ladies to the door ofmr. phillips house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydiaspressing entreaties that they should come in and even in spite ofmrs. phillipss throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding theinvitation.mrs. phillips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldestfrom their recent absence were particularly welcome and she waseagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which astheir own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothingabout if she had not happened to see mr. joness shopboy in thestreet who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts tonetherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civilitywas claimed towards mr. collins by janes introduction of him. shereceived him with her very best politeness which he returned withas much more apologising for his intrusion without any previousacquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himselfhowever might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies whointroduced him to her notice. mrs. phillips was quite awed by such anexcess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soonput to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whomhowever she could only tell her nieces what they already knew thatmr. denny had brought him from london and that he was to have alieutenants commission in the shire. she had been watching him thelast hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr.wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued theoccupation but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of theofficers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupiddisagreeable fellows. some of them were to dine with the phillipsesthe next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr.wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbournwould come in the evening. this was agreed to and mrs. phillipsprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lotterytickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. the prospect of suchdelights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits. mr.collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assuredwith unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen passbetween the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended eitheror both had they appeared to be in the wrong she could no more explainsuch behaviour than her sister.mr. collins on his return highly gratified mrs. bennet by admiringmrs. phillipss manners and politeness. he protested that except ladycatherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant womanfor she had not only received him with the utmost civility but evenpointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening althoughutterly unknown to her before. something he supposed might beattributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with somuch attention in the whole course of his life.chapter as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with theiraunt and all mr. collinss scruples of leaving mr. and mrs. bennet fora single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coachconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton andthe girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawingroomthat mr. wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then inthe house.when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr.collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so muchstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared hemight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfastparlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey muchgratification but when mrs. phillips understood from him whatrosings was and who was its proprietorwhen she had listened to thedescription of only one of lady catherines drawingrooms and foundthat the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt allthe force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparisonwith the housekeepers room.in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansionwith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode andthe improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until thegentlemen joined them and he found in mrs. phillips a very attentivelistener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what sheheard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours assoon as she could. to the girls who could not listen to their cousinand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examinetheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece theinterval of waiting appeared very long. it was over at last however.the gentlemen did approach and when mr. wickham walked into the roomelizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinkingof him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.the officers of the shire were in general a very creditablegentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party butmr. wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air andwalk as they were superior to the broadfaced stuffy uncle phillipsbreathing port wine who followed them into the room.mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye wasturned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seatedhimself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell intoconversation though it was only on its being a wet night made her feelthat the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be renderedinteresting by the skill of the speaker.with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr. wickham and theofficers mr. collins seemed to sink into insignificance to the youngladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kindlistener in mrs. phillips and was by her watchfulness most abundantlysupplied with coffee and muffin. when the cardtables were placed hehad the opportunity of obliging her in turn by sitting down to whist.i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be gladto improve myself for in my situation in life mrs. phillips was veryglad for his compliance but could not wait for his reason.mr. wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was hereceived at the other table between elizabeth and lydia. at first thereseemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a mostdetermined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery ticketsshe soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making betsand exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.allowing for the common demands of the game mr. wickham was thereforeat leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hearhim though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to betoldthe history of his acquaintance with mr. darcy. she dared noteven mention that gentleman. her curiosity however was unexpectedlyrelieved. mr. wickham began the subject himself. he inquired how farnetherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked ina hesitating manner how long mr. darcy had been staying there.about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subjectdrop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire iunderstand.yes replied mr. wickham his estate there is a noble one. a clearten thousand per annum. you could not have met with a person morecapable of giving you certain information on that head than myself fori have been connected with his family in a particular manner from myinfancy.elizabeth could not but look surprised.you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion afterseeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meetingyesterday. are you much acquainted with mr. darcyas much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth very warmly. i havespent four days in the same house with him and i think him verydisagreeable.i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his beingagreeable or otherwise. i am not qualified to form one. i have known himtoo long and too well to be a fair judge. it is impossible for meto be impartial. but i believe your opinion of him would in generalastonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so stronglyanywhere else. here you are in your own family.upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house inthe neighbourhood except netherfield. he is not at all liked inhertfordshire. everybody is disgusted with his pride. you will not findhim more favourably spoken of by anyone.i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a shortinterruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyondtheir deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen. theworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by hishigh and imposing manners and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be anilltempered man. wickham only shook his head.i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he islikely to be in this country much longer.i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when iwas at netherfield. i hope your plans in favour of the shire willnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.oh noit is not for me to be driven away by mr. darcy. if hewishes to avoid seeing me he must go. we are not on friendly termsand it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason foravoiding him but what i might proclaim before all the world a senseof very great illusage and most painful regrets at his being what heis. his father miss bennet the late mr. darcy was one of the best menthat ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can neverbe in company with this mr. darcy without being grieved to the soul bya thousand tender recollections. his behaviour to myself has beenscandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him anything andeverything rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing thememory of his father.elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened withall her heart but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.mr. wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton theneighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all thathe had yet seen and speaking of the latter with gentle but veryintelligible gallantry.it was the prospect of constant society and good society he addedwhich was my chief inducement to enter the shire. i knew it to bea most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted mefurther by his account of their present quarters and the very greatattentions and excellent acquaintances meryton had procured them.society i own is necessary to me. i have been a disappointed man andmy spirits will not bear solitude. i must have employment and society.a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances havenow made it eligible. the church ought to have been my professioniwas brought up for the church and i should at this time have been inpossession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman wewere speaking of just now.indeedyesthe late mr. darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the bestliving in his gift. he was my godfather and excessively attached to me.i cannot do justice to his kindness. he meant to provide for me amplyand thought he had done it but when the living fell it was givenelsewhere.good heavens cried elizabeth but how could that be how could hiswill be disregarded why did you not seek legal redressthere was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as togive me no hope from law. a man of honour could not have doubted theintention but mr. darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merelyconditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claimto it by extravagance imprudencein short anything or nothing. certainit is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i wasof an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and noless certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really doneanything to deserve to lose it. i have a warm unguarded temper andi may have spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely. i canrecall nothing worse. but the fact is that we are very different sortof men and that he hates me.this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced.some time or other he will bebut it shall not be by me. till ican forget his father i can never defy or expose him.elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer thanever as he expressed them.but what said she after a pause can have been his motive what canhave induced him to behave so cruellya thorough determined dislike of mea dislike which i cannot butattribute in some measure to jealousy. had the late mr. darcy liked meless his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommonattachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life. he hadnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sortof preference which was often given me.i had not thought mr. darcy so bad as thisthough i have never likedhim. i had not thought so very ill of him. i had supposed him to bedespising his fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him ofdescending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity asthis.after a few minutes reflection however she continued i doremember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability ofhis resentments of his having an unforgiving temper. his dispositionmust be dreadful.i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can hardlybe just to him.elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed totreat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of hisfather she could have added a young man too like you whose verycountenance may vouch for your being amiablebut she contented herselfwith and one too who had probably been his companion from childhoodconnected together as i think you said in the closest mannerwe were born in the same parish within the same park the greatestpart of our youth was passed together inmates of the same housesharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care. myfather began life in the profession which your uncle mr. phillipsappears to do so much credit tobut he gave up everything to be ofuse to the late mr. darcy and devoted all his time to the care of thepemberley property. he was most highly esteemed by mr. darcy a mostintimate confidential friend. mr. darcy often acknowledged himself tobe under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendenceand when immediately before my fathers death mr. darcy gave him avoluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it tobe as much a debt of gratitude to him as of his affection to myself.how strange cried elizabeth. how abominable i wonder that the verypride of this mr. darcy has not made him just to you if from no bettermotive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfordishonesty i must call it.it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions maybe traced to pride and pride had often been his best friend. it hasconnected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. but we arenone of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were strongerimpulses even than pride.can such abominable pride as his have ever done him goodyes. it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his moneyfreely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve thepoor. family pride and filial pridefor he is very proud of whathis father washave done this. not to appear to disgrace his familyto degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of thepemberley house is a powerful motive. he has also brotherly pridewhich with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind andcareful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried upas the most attentive and best of brothers.what sort of girl is miss darcyhe shook his head. i wish i could call her amiable. it gives me pain tospeak ill of a darcy. but she is too much like her brothervery veryproud. as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fondof me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. but she isnothing to me now. she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteenand i understand highly accomplished. since her fathers death herhome has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends hereducation.after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could nothelp reverting once more to the first and sayingi am astonished at his intimacy with mr. bingley how can mr. bingleywho seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiablebe in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do youknow mr. bingleynot at all.he is a sweettempered amiable charming man. he cannot know what mr.darcy is.probably not but mr. darcy can please where he chooses. he does notwant abilities. he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worthhis while. among those who are at all his equals in consequence he isa very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. hispride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberalminded justsincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeableallowing somethingfor fortune and figure.the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered roundthe other table and mr. collins took his station between his cousinelizabeth and mrs. phillips. the usual inquiries as to his success wasmade by the latter. it had not been very great he had lost everypoint but when mrs. phillips began to express her concern thereuponhe assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the leastimportance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and beggedthat she would not make herself uneasy.i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to acardtable they must take their chances of these things and happily iam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. thereare undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to ladycatherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regardinglittle matters.mr. wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr. collins fora few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relationwas very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh.lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given hima living. i hardly know how mr. collins was first introduced to hernotice but he certainly has not known her long.you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcywere sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr. darcy.no indeed i did not. i knew nothing at all of lady catherinesconnections. i never heard of her existence till the day beforeyesterday.her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it isbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor missbingley. vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless heraffection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were alreadyselfdestined for another.mr. collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and herdaughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyshipi suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being hispatroness she is an arrogant conceited woman.i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i havenot seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never likedher and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. she has thereputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believeshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part fromher authoritative manner and the rest from the pride for hernephew who chooses that everyone connected with him should have anunderstanding of the first class.elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it andthey continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supperput an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr.wickhams attentions. there could be no conversation in the noiseof mrs. phillipss supper party but his manners recommended him toeverybody. whatever he said was said well and whatever he did donegracefully. elizabeth went away with her head full of him. she couldthink of nothing but of mr. wickham and of what he had told her allthe way home but there was not time for her even to mention his nameas they went for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent. lydiatalked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and thefish she had won and mr. collins in describing the civility of mr. andmrs. phillips protesting that he did not in the least regard his lossesat whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearingthat he crowded his cousins had more to say than he could well managebefore the carriage stopped at longbourn house.chapter elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr.wickham and herself. jane listened with astonishment and concern sheknew not how to believe that mr. darcy could be so unworthy of mr.bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question theveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham. thepossibility of his having endured such unkindness was enough tointerest all her tender feelings and nothing remained therefore to bedone but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of eachand throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not beotherwise explained.they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some wayor other of which we can form no idea. interested people have perhapsmisrepresented each to the other. it is in short impossible for us toconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated themwithout actual blame on either side.very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say onbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in thebusiness do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill ofsomebody.laugh as much as you choose but you will not laugh me out of myopinion. my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful lightit places mr. darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in sucha manner one whom his father had promised to provide for. it isimpossible. no man of common humanity no man who had any value for hischaracter could be capable of it. can his most intimate friends be soexcessively deceived in him oh no.i can much more easily believe mr. bingleys being imposed on thanthat mr. wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave melast night names facts everything mentioned without ceremony. if itbe not so let mr. darcy contradict it. besides there was truth in hislooks.it is difficult indeedit is distressing. one does not know what tothink.i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think.but jane could think with certainty on only one pointthat mr. bingleyif he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affairbecame public.the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where thisconversation passed by the arrival of the very persons of whom they hadbeen speaking mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their personalinvitation for the longexpected ball at netherfield which was fixedfor the following tuesday. the two ladies were delighted to see theirdear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedlyasked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. tothe rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs. bennetas much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all tothe others. they were soon gone again rising from their seats with anactivity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as ifeager to escape from mrs. bennets civilities.the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to everyfemale of the family. mrs. bennet chose to consider it as given incompliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flatteredby receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself instead of aceremonious card. jane pictured to herself a happy evening in thesociety of her two friends and the attentions of her brother andelizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr.wickham and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr. darcys lookand behavior. the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia dependedless on any single event or any particular person for though theyeach like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickhamhe was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ballwas at any rate a ball. and even mary could assure her family that shehad no disinclination for it.while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enoughithink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of thosewho consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable foreverybody.elizabeths spirits were so high on this occasion that though she didnot often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins she could not help askinghim whether he intended to accept mr. bingleys invitation and ifhe did whether he would think it proper to join in the eveningsamusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained noscruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebukeeither from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing todance.i am by no means of the opinion i assure you said he that a ballof this kind given by a young man of character to respectable peoplecan have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancingmyself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my faircousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity ofsoliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especiallya preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the rightcause and not to any disrespect for her.elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. she had fully proposed beingengaged by mr. wickham for those very dances and to have mr. collinsinstead her liveliness had never been worse timed. there was no helpfor it however. mr. wickhams happiness and her own were perforcedelayed a little longer and mr. collinss proposal accepted with asgood a grace as she could. she was not the better pleased with hisgallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. it now firststruck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthyof being mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form aquadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors.the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasingcivilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at acompliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished thangratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long beforeher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriagewas extremely agreeable to her. elizabeth however did not chooseto take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be theconsequence of any reply. mr. collins might never make the offer andtill he did it was useless to quarrel about him.if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of theyounger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at thistime for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball therewas such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to merytononce. no aunt no officers no news could be sought afterthe veryshoeroses for netherfield were got by proxy. even elizabeth might havefound some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended theimprovement of her acquaintance with mr. wickham and nothing less thana dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday andmonday endurable to kitty and lydia.chapter till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and looked invain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled adoubt of his being present had never occurred to her. the certaintyof meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections thatmight not unreasonably have alarmed her. she had dressed with more thanusual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of allthat remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more thanmight be won in the course of the evening. but in an instant arosethe dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr. darcyspleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and thoughthis was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence waspronounced by his friend denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and whotold them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business theday before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smilei do not imagine his business would have called him away just now ifhe had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught byelizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable forwickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just everyfeeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediatedisappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility tothe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.attendance forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham. shewas resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned awaywith a degree of illhumour which she could not wholly surmount even inspeaking to mr. bingley whose blind partiality provoked her.but elizabeth was not formed for illhumour and though every prospectof her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on herspirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she hadnot seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transitionto the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particularnotice. the first two dances however brought a return of distressthey were dances of mortification. mr. collins awkward and solemnapologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without beingaware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeablepartner for a couple of dances can give. the moment of her release fromhim was ecstasy.she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking ofwickham and of hearing that he was universally liked. when those danceswere over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation withher when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy who tookher so much by surprise in his application for her hand thatwithout knowing what she did she accepted him. he walked away againimmediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence ofmind charlotte tried to console heri dare say you will find him very agreeable.heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to finda man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such anevil.when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim herhand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be asimpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasantin the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. elizabeth made noanswer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to whichshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy andreading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholdingit. they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began toimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and atfirst was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it wouldbe the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she madesome slight observation on the dance. he replied and was againsilent. after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second timewithit is your turn to say something now mr. darcy. i talkedabout the dance and you ought to make some sort of remark on the sizeof the room or the number of couples.he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should besaid.very well. that reply will do for the present. perhaps by and by i mayobserve that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. butnow we may be silent.do you talk by rule then while you are dancingsometimes. one must speak a little you know. it would look odd to beentirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage ofsome conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have thetrouble of saying as little as possible.are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do youimagine that you are gratifying mineboth replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a greatsimilarity in the turn of our minds. we are each of an unsocialtaciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to saysomething that will amaze the whole room and be handed down toposterity with all the eclat of a proverb.this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am suresaid he. how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say. youthink it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.i must not decide on my own performance.he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone downthe dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very oftenwalk to meryton. she answered in the affirmative and unable to resistthe temptation added when you met us there the other day we had justbeen forming a new acquaintance.the effect was immediate. a deeper shade of hauteur overspread hisfeatures but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herselffor her own weakness could not go on. at length darcy spoke and in aconstrained manner said mr. wickham is blessed with such happy mannersas may ensure his making friendswhether he may be equally capable ofretaining them is less certain.he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabethwith emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from allhis life.darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject. atthat moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to passthrough the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr.darcy he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him onhis dancing and his partner.i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir. such verysuperior dancing is not often seen. it is evident that you belong to thefirst circles. allow me to say however that your fair partner does notdisgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeatedespecially when a certain desirable event my dear eliza glancing ather sister and bingley shall take place. what congratulations will thenflow in i appeal to mr. darcybut let me not interrupt you sir. youwill not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of thatyoung lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sirwilliams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and hiseyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley andjane who were dancing together. recovering himself however shortlyhe turned to his partner and said sir williams interruption has mademe forget what we were talking of.i do not think we were speaking at all. sir william could not haveinterrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what weare to talk of next i cannot imagine.what think you of books said he smiling.booksoh no. i am sure we never read the same or not with the samefeelings.i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least beno want of subject. we may compare our different opinions.noi cannot talk of books in a ballroom my head is always full ofsomething else.the present always occupies you in such scenesdoes it said hewith a look of doubt.yes always she replied without knowing what she said for herthoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appearedby her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr. darcythat you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created wasunappeasable. you are very cautious i suppose as to its beingcreated.i am said he with a firm voice.and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudicei hope not.it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinionto be secure of judging properly at first.may i ask to what these questions tendmerely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouringto shake off her gravity. i am trying to make it out.and what is your successshe shook her head. i do not get on at all. i hear such differentaccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.i can readily believe answered he gravely that reports may varygreatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you werenot to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason tofear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have anotheropportunity.i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied.she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted insilence and on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degreefor in darcys breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towardsher which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger againstanother.they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her andwith an expression of civil disdain accosted herso miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickhamyour sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousandquestions and i find that the young man quite forgot to tell you amonghis other communication that he was the son of old wickham the latemr. darcys steward. let me recommend you however as a friend not togive implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr. darcysusing him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he hasalways been remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treatedmr. darcy in a most infamous manner. i do not know the particulars buti know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame that hecannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brotherthought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation tothe officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himselfout of the way. his coming into the country at all is a most insolentthing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it. i pity youmiss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but reallyconsidering his descent one could not expect much better.his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same saidelizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worsethan of being the son of mr. darcys steward and of that i canassure you he informed me himself.i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer.excuse my interferenceit was kindly meant.insolent girl said elizabeth to herself. you are much mistakenif you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. i seenothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr.darcy. she then sought her eldest sister who has undertaken to makeinquiries on the same subject of bingley. jane met her with a smile ofsuch sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficientlymarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude forwickham resentment against his enemies and everything else gave waybefore the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness.i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than hersisters what you have learnt about mr. wickham. but perhaps you havebeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which caseyou may be sure of my pardon.no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothingsatisfactory to tell you. mr. bingley does not know the whole ofhis history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which haveprincipally offended mr. darcy but he will vouch for the good conductthe probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced thatmr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he hasreceived and i am sorry to say by his account as well as his sistersmr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man. i am afraid he hasbeen very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr. darcys regard.mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himselfno he never saw him till the other morning at meryton.this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy. i amsatisfied. but what does he say of the livinghe does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heardthem from mr. darcy more than once but he believes that it was left tohim conditionally only.i have not a doubt of mr. bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmlybut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. mr.bingleys defense of his friend was a very able one i dare say butsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learntthe rest from that friend himself i shall venture to still think ofboth gentlemen as i did before.she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and onwhich there could be no difference of sentiment. elizabeth listened withdelight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of mr.bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidencein it. on their being joined by mr. bingley himself elizabeth withdrewto miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her lastpartner she had scarcely replied before mr. collins came up to themand told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate asto make a most important discovery.i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is nowin the room a near relation of my patroness. i happened to overhear thegentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours ofthe house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother ladycatherine. how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would havethought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine debourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is madein time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going todo and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. my totalignorance of the connection must plead my apology.you are not going to introduce yourself to mr. darcyindeed i am. i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.i believe him to be lady catherines nephew. it will be in my power toassure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday sennight.elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring himthat mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introductionas an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt thatit was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on eitherside and that if it were it must belong to mr. darcy the superior inconsequence to begin the acquaintance. mr. collins listened to herwith the determined air of following his own inclination and when sheceased speaking replied thusmy dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world inyour excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of yourunderstanding but permit me to say that there must be a widedifference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laityand those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe thati consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity withthe highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility ofbehaviour is at the same time maintained. you must therefore allow me tofollow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me toperform what i look on as a point of duty. pardon me for neglecting toprofit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constantguide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted byeducation and habitual study to decide on what is right than a younglady like yourself. and with a low bow he left her to attack mr.darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whoseastonishment at being so addressed was very evident. her cousin prefacedhis speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word ofit she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips thewords apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh. it vexedher to see him expose himself to such a man. mr. darcy was eyeing himwith unrestrained wonder and when at last mr. collins allowed him timeto speak replied with an air of distant civility. mr. collins howeverwas not discouraged from speaking again and mr. darcys contempt seemedabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at theend of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way. mr.collins then returned to elizabeth.i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with myreception. mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. he answeredme with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of sayingthat he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to becertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. it was really a veryhandsome thought. upon the whole i am much pleased with him.as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turnedher attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley and thetrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth tomade her perhaps almost as happy as jane. she saw her in idea settled inthat very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affectioncould bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances ofendeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters. her mothers thoughtsshe plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not toventure near her lest she might hear too much. when they sat down tosupper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness whichplaced them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to findthat her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freelyopenly and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soonbe married to mr. bingley. it was an animating subject and mrs. bennetseemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of thematch. his being such a charming young man and so rich and living butthree miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation andthen it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were ofjane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much asshe could do. it was moreover such a promising thing for her youngerdaughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way ofother rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to beable to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister thatshe might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. it wasnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because onsuch occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs.bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. sheconcluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equallyfortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was nochance of it.in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her motherswords or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audiblewhisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that thechief of it was overheard by mr. darcy who sat opposite to them. hermother only scolded her for being nonsensical.what is mr. darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him i amsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to saynothing he may not like to hear.for heavens sake madam speak lower. what advantage can it be for youto offend mr. darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend byso doingnothing that she could say however had any influence. her mother wouldtalk of her views in the same intelligible tone. elizabeth blushed andblushed again with shame and vexation. she could not help frequentlyglancing her eye at mr. darcy though every glance convinced her of whatshe dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she wasconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. the expressionof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed andsteady gravity.at length however mrs. bennet had no more to say and lady lucas whohad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw nolikelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham andchicken. elizabeth now began to revive. but not long was the interval oftranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of andshe had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreatypreparing to oblige the company. by many significant looks and silententreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisancebut in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity ofexhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song. elizabethseyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched herprogress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was veryill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanksof the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on tofavour them again after the pause of half a minute began another.marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice wasweak and her manner affected. elizabeth was in agonies. she looked atjane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking tobingley. she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signsof derision at each other and at darcy who continued howeverimperturbably grave. she looked at her father to entreat hisinterference lest mary should be singing all night. he took the hintand when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will doextremely well child. you have delighted us long enough. let the otheryoung ladies have time to exhibit.mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted andelizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraidher anxiety had done no good. others of the party were now applied to.if i said mr. collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing ishould have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with anair for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectlycompatible with the profession of a clergyman. i do not mean howeverto assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our timeto music for there are certainly other things to be attended to. therector of a parish has much to do. in the first place he must makesuch an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and notoffensive to his patron. he must write his own sermons and the timethat remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the careand improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from makingas comfortable as possible. and i do not think it of light importancethat he should have attentive and conciliatory manner towards everybodyespecially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. i cannot acquithim of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit anoccasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with thefamily. and with a bow to mr. darcy he concluded his speech which hadbeen spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. many staredmanysmiled but no one looked more amused than mr. bennet himself while hiswife seriously commended mr. collins for having spoken so sensiblyand observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkablyclever good kind of young man.to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement toexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening it wouldhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit orfiner success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sisterthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that hisfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which hemust have witnessed. that his two sisters and mr. darcy however shouldhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enoughand she could not determine whether the silent contempt of thegentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable.the rest of the evening brought her little amusement. she was teased bymr. collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and thoughhe could not prevail on her to dance with him again put it out of herpower to dance with others. in vain did she entreat him to stand up withsomebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to itthat his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself toher and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to herthe whole evening. there was no arguing upon such a project. she owedher greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them andgoodnaturedly engaged mr. collinss conversation to herself.she was at least free from the offense of mr. darcys further noticethough often standing within a very short distance of her quitedisengaged he never came near enough to speak. she felt it to be theprobable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham and rejoiced init.the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and bya manoeuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter ofan hour after everybody else was gone which gave them time to see howheartily they were wished away by some of the family. mrs. hurst and hersister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue andwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. they repulsedevery attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation and by so doing threw alanguor over the whole party which was very little relieved by thelong speeches of mr. collins who was complimenting mr. bingley and hissisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality andpoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. darcy saidnothing at all. mr. bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene.mr. bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from therest and talked only to each other. elizabeth preserved as steady asilence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was toomuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lordhow tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn.when at length they arose to take leave mrs. bennet was most pressinglycivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn andaddressed herself especially to mr. bingley to assure him how happy hewould make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time withoutthe ceremony of a formal invitation. bingley was all grateful pleasureand he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting onher after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the nextday for a short time.mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under thedelightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations ofsettlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedlysee her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or fourmonths. of having another daughter married to mr. collins she thoughtwith equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure.elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though theman and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of eachwas eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield.chapter the next day opened a new scene at longbourn. mr. collins made hisdeclaration in form. having resolved to do it without loss of time ashis leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and havingno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even atthe moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all theobservances which he supposed a regular part of the business. onfinding mrs. bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls togethersoon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these wordsmay i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabethwhen i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in thecourse of this morningbefore elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise mrs.bennet answered instantly oh dearyescertainly. i am sure lizzywill be very happyi am sure she can have no objection. come kitty iwant you upstairs. and gathering her work together she was hasteningaway when elizabeth called outdear madam do not go. i beg you will not go. mr. collins must excuseme. he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. i amgoing away myself.no no nonsense lizzy. i desire you to stay where you are. and uponelizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about toescape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr.collins.elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a momentsconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get itover as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried toconceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided betweendistress and diversion. mrs. bennet and kitty walked off and as soon asthey were gone mr. collins began.believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far fromdoing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections. youwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this littleunwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respectedmothers permission for this address. you can hardly doubt thepurport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you todissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. almost assoon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion ofmy future life. but before i am run away with by my feelings on thissubject perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons formarryingand moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the designof selecting a wife as i certainly did.the idea of mr. collins with all his solemn composure being run awaywith by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she couldnot use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him furtherand he continuedmy reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing forevery clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the exampleof matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced that it willadd very greatly to my happiness and thirdlywhich perhaps i oughtto have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice andrecommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of callingpatroness. twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unaskedtoo on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before ileft hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille while mrs. jenkinson wasarranging miss de bourghs footstool that she said mr. collins youmust marry. a clergyman like you must marry. choose properly choosea gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an activeuseful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a smallincome go a good way. this is my advice. find such a woman as soon asyou can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her. allow me by theway to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the noticeand kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of theadvantages in my power to offer. you will find her manners beyondanything i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must beacceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence andrespect which her rank will inevitably excite. thus much for my generalintention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my viewswere directed towards longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where ican assure you there are many amiable young women. but the fact is thatbeing as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honouredfather who however may live many years longer i could not satisfymyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters thatthe loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholyevent takes placewhich however as i have already said may notbe for several years. this has been my motive my fair cousin andi flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. and now nothingremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of theviolence of my affection. to fortune i am perfectly indifferent andshall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am wellaware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand poundsin the four per cents which will not be yours till after your mothersdecease is all that you may ever be entitled to. on that headtherefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself thatno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.you are too hasty sir she cried. you forget that i have made noanswer. let me do it without further loss of time. accept my thanks forthe compliment you are paying me. i am very sensible of the honour ofyour proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than todecline them.i am not now to learn replied mr. collins with a formal wave of thehand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of theman whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for theirfavour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even athird time. i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have justsaid and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is a ratherextraordinary one after my declaration. i do assure you that i am notone of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are sodaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a secondtime. i am perfectly serious in my refusal. you could not make mehappy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world whocould make you so. nay were your friend lady catherine to know me iam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for thesituation.were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr. collinsvery gravelybut i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at alldisapprove of you. and you may be certain when i have the honour ofseeing her again i shall speak in the very highest terms of yourmodesty economy and other amiable qualification.indeed mr. collins all praise of me will be unnecessary. youmust give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the complimentof believing what i say. i wish you very happy and very rich and byrefusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of yourfeelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbournestate whenever it falls without any selfreproach. this matter maybe considered therefore as finally settled. and rising as shethus spoke she would have quitted the room had mr. collins not thusaddressed herwhen i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject ishall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now givenme though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because iknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man onthe first application and perhaps you have even now said as much toencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of thefemale character.really mr. collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle meexceedingly. if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the formof encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way asto convince you of its being one.you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that yourrefusal of my addresses is merely words of course. my reasons forbelieving it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand isunworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer wouldbe any other than highly desirable. my situation in life my connectionswith the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own arecircumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into furtherconsideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by nomeans certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. yourportion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undothe effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. as i musttherefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of mei shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love bysuspense according to the usual practice of elegant females.i do assure you sir that i have no pretensions whatever to that kindof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. i wouldrather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. i thank youagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals butto accept them is absolutely impossible. my feelings in every respectforbid it. can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegantfemale intending to plague you but as a rational creature speakingthe truth from her heart.you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkwardgallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the expressauthority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail ofbeing acceptable.to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would makeno reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined ifhe persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flatteringencouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be utteredin such a manner as to be decisive and whose behavior at least couldnot be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.chapter mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of hissuccessful love for mrs. bennet having dawdled about in the vestibuleto watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth openthe door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than sheentered the breakfastroom and congratulated both him and herself inwarm terms on the happy prospect or their nearer connection. mr. collinsreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and thenproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the resultof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since therefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flowfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.this information however startled mrs. bennet she would have beenglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encouragehim by protesting against his proposals but she dared not believe itand could not help saying so.but depend upon it mr. collins she added that lizzy shall bebrought to reason. i will speak to her about it directly. she is a veryheadstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i willmake her know it.pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr. collins but ifshe is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she wouldaltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation whonaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. if therefore sheactually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better notto force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects oftemper she could not contribute much to my felicity.sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs. bennet alarmed. lizzy isonly headstrong in such matters as these. in everything else she is asgoodnatured a girl as ever lived. i will go directly to mr. bennet andwe shall very soon settle it with her i am sure.she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to herhusband called out as she entered the library oh mr. bennet youare wanted immediately we are all in an uproar. you must come and makelizzy marry mr. collins for she vows she will not have him and if youdo not make haste he will change his mind and not have her.mr. bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed themon her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered byher communication.i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she hadfinished her speech. of what are you talkingof mr. collins and lizzy. lizzy declares she will not have mr. collinsand mr. collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy.and what am i to do on the occasion it seems an hopeless business.speak to lizzy about it yourself. tell her that you insist upon hermarrying him.let her be called down. she shall hear my opinion.mrs. bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to thelibrary.come here child cried her father as she appeared. i have sent foryou on an affair of importance. i understand that mr. collins has madeyou an offer of marriage. is it true elizabeth replied that it was.very welland this offer of marriage you have refusedi have sir.very well. we now come to the point. your mother insists upon youraccepting it. is it not so mrs. bennetyes or i will never see her again.an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth. from this day you mustbe a stranger to one of your parents. your mother will never see youagain if you do not marry mr. collins and i will never see you againif you do.elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginningbut mrs. bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded theaffair as she wished was excessively disappointed.what do you mean mr. bennet in talking this way you promised me toinsist upon her marrying him.my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request.first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on thepresent occasion and secondly of my room. i shall be glad to have thelibrary to myself as soon as may be.not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband didmrs. bennet give up the point. she talked to elizabeth again and againcoaxed and threatened her by turns. she endeavoured to secure janein her interest but jane with all possible mildness declinedinterfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness andsometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks. though her mannervaried however her determination never did.mr. collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed.he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousincould refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no otherway. his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of herdeserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret.while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spendthe day with them. she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying toher cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is suchfun here what do you think has happened this morning mr. collins hasmade an offer to lizzy and she will not have him.charlotte hardly had time to answer before they were joined by kittywho came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered thebreakfastroom where mrs. bennet was alone than she likewise began onthe subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreatingher to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all herfamily. pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tonefor nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me. i am cruelly usednobody feels for my poor nerves.charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth.aye there she comes continued mrs. bennet looking as unconcernedas may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york providedshe can have her own way. but i tell you miss lizzyif you take itinto your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this wayyou will never get a husband at alland i am sure i do not know who isto maintain you when your father is dead. i shall not be able to keepyouand so i warn you. i have done with you from this very day. i toldyou in the library you know that i should never speak to you againand you will find me as good as my word. i have no pleasure in talkingto undutiful children. not that i have much pleasure indeed in talkingto anybody. people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can haveno great inclination for talking. nobody can tell what i suffer but itis always so. those who do not complain are never pitied.her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible thatany attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase theirritation. she talked on therefore without interruption from any ofthem till they were joined by mr. collins who entered the room withan air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said tothe girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you holdyour tongues and let me and mr. collins have a little conversationtogether.elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed butlydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlottedetained first by the civility of mr. collins whose inquiries afterherself and all her family were very minute and then by a littlecuriosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretendingnot to hear. in a doleful voice mrs. bennet began the projectedconversation oh mr. collinsmy dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point.far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked hisdispleasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter. resignationto inevitable evils is the evil duty of us all the peculiar duty of ayoung man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early prefermentand i trust i am resigned. perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubtof my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her handfor i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect aswhen the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in ourestimation. you will not i hope consider me as showing any disrespectto your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions toyour daughters favour without having paid yourself and mr. bennet thecompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in mybehalf. my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted mydismission from your daughters lips instead of your own. but we are allliable to error. i have certainly meant well through the whole affair.my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with dueconsideration for the advantage of all your family and if my mannerhas been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise.chapter the discussion of mr. collinss offer was now nearly at an end andelizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarilyattending it and occasionally from some peevish allusions of hermother. as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chieflyexpressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid herbut by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. he scarcely ever spoketo her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible ofhimself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whosecivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all andespecially to her friend.the morrow produced no abatement of mrs. bennets illhumour or illhealth. mr. collins was also in the same state of angry pride. elizabethhad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan didnot appear in the least affected by it. he was always to have gone onsaturday and to saturday he meant to stay.after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr. wickhamwere returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball.he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to theiraunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody waswell talked over. to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledgedthat the necessity of his absence had been selfimposed.i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meetmr. darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for somany hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenesmight arise unpleasant to more than myself.she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a fulldiscussion of it and for all the commendation which they civillybestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back withthem to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended toher. his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all thecompliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as anoccasion of introducing him to her father and mother.soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it camefrom netherfield. the envelope contained a sheet of elegant littlehotpressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand andelizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and sawher dwelling intently on some particular passages. jane recollectedherself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usualcheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxietyon the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and nosooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from janeinvited her to follow her upstairs. when they had gained their own roomjane taking out the letter saidthis is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a gooddeal. the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are ontheir way to townand without any intention of coming back again. youshall hear what she says.she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the informationof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directlyand of their meaning to dine in grosvenor street where mr. hurst had ahouse. the next was in these words i do not pretend to regret anythingi shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friendbut we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of thatdelightful intercourse we have known and in the meanwhile maylessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreservedcorrespondence. i depend on you for that. to these highflownexpressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrustand though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she sawnothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that theirabsence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingleys being there and asto the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must cease toregard it in the enjoyment of his.it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not beable to see your friends before they leave the country. but may we nothope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looksforward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightfulintercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greatersatisfaction as sisters mr. bingley will not be detained in london bythem.caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return intohertfordshire this winter. i will read it to youwhen my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business whichtook him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as weare certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that whencharles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we havedetermined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spendhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. many of my acquaintances arealready there for the winter i wish that i could hear that you mydearest friend had any intention of making one of the crowdbut ofthat i despair. i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire mayabound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that yourbeaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of thethree of whom we shall deprive you.it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more thiswinter.it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean that he should.why will you think so it must be his own doing. he is his ownmaster. but you do not know all. i will read you the passage whichparticularly hurts me. i will have no reserves from you.mr. darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truthwe are scarcely less eager to meet her again. i really do not thinkgeorgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishmentsand the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened intosomething still more interesting from the hope we dare entertain ofher being hereafter our sister. i do not know whether i ever beforementioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave thecountry without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem themunreasonable. my brother admires her greatly already he will havefrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footingher relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sisterspartiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles mostcapable of engaging any womans heart. with all these circumstances tofavour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearestjane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happinessof so manywhat do you think of this sentence my dear lizzy said jane as shefinished it. is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare thatcaroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she isperfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if shesuspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly toput me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subjectyes there can for mine is totally different. will you hear itmost willingly.you shall have it in a few words. miss bingley sees that her brother isin love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy. she follows himto town in hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that hedoes not care about you.jane shook her head.indeed jane you ought to believe me. no one who has ever seen youtogether can doubt his affection. miss bingley i am sure cannot. sheis not such a simpleton. could she have seen half as much love in mr.darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes. but thecase is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and sheis the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notionthat when there has been one intermarriage she may have less troublein achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity andi dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way. butmy dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingleytells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallestdegree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you ontuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that insteadof being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend.if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane yourrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy. but i know thefoundation is unjust. caroline is incapable of wilfully deceivinganyone and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceivingherself.that is right. you could not have started a more happy idea since youwill not take comfort in mine. believe her to be deceived by all means.you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer.but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best inaccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marryelsewhereyou must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon maturedeliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters ismore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you byall means to refuse him.how can you talk so said jane faintly smiling. you must know thatthough i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i couldnot hesitate.i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consideryour situation with much compassion.but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never berequired. a thousand things may arise in six monthsthe idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmostcontempt. it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolinesinterested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that thosewishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young manso totally independent of everyone.she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felton the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hopethough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope thatbingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of thefamily without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conductbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concernand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happento go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. afterlamenting it however at some length she had the consolation that mr.bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and theconclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he hadbeen invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have twofull courses.chapter the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during thechief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr. collins.elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. it keeps him in goodhumour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express.charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful andthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. this wasvery amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabethhad any conception of its object was nothing else than to secure herfrom any return of mr. collinss addresses by engaging them towardsherself. such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were sofavourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almostsecure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so verysoon. but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of hischaracter for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the nextmorning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throwhimself at her feet. he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousinsfrom a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail toconjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt knowntill its success might be known likewise for though feeling almostsecure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraginghe was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday.his reception however was of the most flattering kind. miss lucasperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house andinstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. but little hadshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.in as short a time as mr. collinss long speeches would alloweverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and asthey entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day thatwas to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation mustbe waived for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle withhis happiness. the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature mustguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for itscontinuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pureand disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon thatestablishment were gained.sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consentand it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. mr. collinss presentcircumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whomthey could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth wereexceedingly fair. lady lucas began directly to calculate with moreinterest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longermr. bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decidedopinion that whenever mr. collins should be in possession of thelongbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wifeshould make their appearance at st. jamess. the whole family in shortwere properly overjoyed on the occasion. the younger girls formed hopesof coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise havedone and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottesdying an old maid. charlotte herself was tolerably composed. she hadgained her point and had time to consider of it. her reflections werein general satisfactory. mr. collins to be sure was neither sensiblenor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her mustbe imaginary. but still he would be her husband. without thinking highlyeither of men or matrimony marriage had always been her object it wasthe only provision for welleducated young women of small fortuneand however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantestpreservative from want. this preservative she had now obtained and atthe age of twentyseven without having ever been handsome she felt allthe good luck of it. the least agreeable circumstance in the businesswas the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendshipshe valued beyond that of any other person. elizabeth would wonderand probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to beshaken her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. she resolvedto give her the information herself and therefore charged mr. collinswhen he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what hadpassed before any of the family. a promise of secrecy was of course verydutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for thecuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very directquestions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he wasat the same time exercising great selfdenial for he was longing topublish his prosperous love.as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of thefamily the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies movedfor the night and mrs. bennet with great politeness and cordialitysaid how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again wheneverhis engagements might allow him to visit them.my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularlygratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive andyou may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon aspossible.they were all astonished and mr. bennet who could by no means wish forso speedy a return immediately saidbut is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here mygood sir you had better neglect your relations than run the risk ofoffending your patroness.my dear sir replied mr. collins i am particularly obliged to youfor this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking somaterial a step without her ladyships concurrence.you cannot be too much upon your guard. risk anything rather than herdispleasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to usagain which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at homeand be satisfied that we shall take no offence.believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by suchaffectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receivefrom me a letter of thanks for this and for every other mark of yourregard during my stay in hertfordshire. as for my fair cousins thoughmy absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall nowtake the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting mycousin elizabeth.with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equallysurprised that he meditated a quick return. mrs. bennet wished tounderstand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of heryounger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there wasa solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by nomeans so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to readand improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a veryagreeable companion. but on the following morning every hope of thiskind was done away. miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in aprivate conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before.the possibility of mr. collinss fancying himself in love with herfriend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two butthat charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far frompossibility as she could encourage him herself and her astonishment wasconsequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum andshe could not help crying outengaged to mr. collins my dear charlotteimpossiblethe steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling herstory gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct areproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regainedher composure and calmly repliedwhy should you be surprised my dear eliza do you think it incrediblethat mr. collins should be able to procure any womans good opinionbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with youbut elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effortfor it was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect oftheir relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished herall imaginable happiness.i see what you are feeling replied charlotte. you must be surprisedvery much surprisedso lately as mr. collins was wishing to marryyou. but when you have had time to think it over i hope you will besatisfied with what i have done. i am not romantic you know i neverwas. i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr. collinsscharacter connection and situation in life i am convinced that mychance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast onentering the marriage state.elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pausethey returned to the rest of the family. charlotte did not stay muchlonger and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of sounsuitable a match. the strangeness of mr. collinss making two offersof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being nowaccepted. she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony wasnot exactly like her own but she had not supposed it to be possiblethat when called into action she would have sacrificed every betterfeeling to worldly advantage. charlotte the wife of mr. collins was amost humiliating picture and to the pang of a friend disgracing herselfand sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that itwas impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she hadchosen.chapter elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on whatshe had heard and doubting whether she was authorised to mentionit when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter toannounce her engagement to the family. with many compliments to themand much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between thehouses he unfolded the matterto an audience not merely wondering butincredulous for mrs. bennet with more perseverance than politenessprotested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded andoften uncivil boisterously exclaimedgood lord sir william how can you tell such a story do not you knowthat mr. collins wants to marry lizzynothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have bornewithout anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carriedhim through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to thetruth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with themost forbearing courtesy.elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasanta situation now put herself forward to confirm his account bymentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself andendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sistersby the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which shewas readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on thehappiness that might be expected from the match the excellent characterof mr. collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london.mrs. bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal whilesir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelingsfound a rapid vent. in the first place she persisted in disbelievingthe whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr. collinshad been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never behappy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off. twoinferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one thatelizabeth was the real cause of the mischief and the other that sheherself had been barbarously misused by them all and on these twopoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. nothing couldconsole and nothing could appease her. nor did that day wear out herresentment. a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth withoutscolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir williamor lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before shecould at all forgive their daughter.mr. bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and suchas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort forit gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he hadbeen used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife andmore foolish than his daughterjane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she saidless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happinessnor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. kittyand lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr. collins was only aclergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of newsto spread at meryton.lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retorton mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and shecalled at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she wasthough mrs. bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have beenenough to drive happiness away.between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept themmutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded thatno real confidence could ever subsist between them again. herdisappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to hersister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion couldnever be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxiousas bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of hisreturn.jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was countingthe days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. the promisedletter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday addressed totheir father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which atwelvemonths abode in the family might have prompted. after discharginghis conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with manyrapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affectionof their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it wasmerely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so readyto close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whitherhe hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherinehe added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to takeplace as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerableargument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making himthe happiest of men.mr. collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter ofpleasure to mrs. bennet. on the contrary she was as much disposed tocomplain of it as her husband. it was very strange that he should cometo longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenientand exceedingly troublesome. she hated having visitors in the housewhile her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people themost disagreeable. such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet andthey gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingleys continuedabsence.neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. day afterday passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than thereport which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more tonetherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrs.bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalousfalsehood.even elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut thathis sisters would be successful in keeping him away. unwilling asshe was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness and sodishonorable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent itsfrequently occurring. the united efforts of his two unfeeling sistersand of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of missdarcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared forthe strength of his attachment.as for jane her anxiety under this suspense was of course morepainful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous ofconcealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subjectwas never alluded to. but as no such delicacy restrained her motheran hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express herimpatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if hedid not come back she would think herself very ill used. it neededall janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerabletranquillity.mr. collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight but hisreception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on hisfirst introduction. he was too happy however to need much attentionand luckily for the others the business of lovemaking relieved themfrom a great deal of his company. the chief of every day was spent byhim at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in timeto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.mrs. bennet was really in a most pitiable state. the very mention ofanything concerning the match threw her into an agony of illhumourand wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. the sightof miss lucas was odious to her. as her successor in that house sheregarded her with jealous abhorrence. whenever charlotte came to seethem she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession andwhenever she spoke in a low voice to mr. collins was convinced thatthey were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herselfand her daughters out of the house as soon as mr. bennet were dead. shecomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.indeed mr. bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlottelucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced tomake way for her and live to see her take her place in itmy dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. let us hope forbetter things. let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor.this was not very consoling to mrs. bennet and therefore instead ofmaking any answer she went on as before.i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. if it wasnot for the entail i should not mind it.what should not you mindi should not mind anything at all.let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of suchinsensibility.i never can be thankful mr. bennet for anything about the entail. howanyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones owndaughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr. collins toowhy should he have it more than anybody elsei leave it to yourself to determine said mr. bennet.chapter miss bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt. the very firstsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london forthe winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having hadtime to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he leftthe country.hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the restof the letter she found little except the professed affection of thewriter that could give her any comfort. miss darcys praise occupiedthe chief of it. her many attractions were again dwelt on and carolineboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predictthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her formerletter. she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being aninmate of mr. darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans ofthe latter with regard to new furniture.elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all thisheard it in silent indignation. her heart was divided between concernfor her sister and resentment against all others. to carolinesassertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid nocredit. that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than shehad ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him shecould not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easinessof temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slaveof his designing friends and led him to sacrifice of his own happinessto the caprice of their inclination. had his own happiness howeverbeen the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it inwhatever manner he thought best but her sisters was involved in it asshe thought he must be sensible himself. it was a subject in shorton which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing. shecould think of nothing else and yet whether bingleys regard had reallydied away or were suppressed by his friends interference whetherhe had been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped hisobservation whatever were the case though her opinion of him must bematerially affected by the difference her sisters situation remainedthe same her peace equally wounded.a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings toelizabeth but at last on mrs. bennets leaving them together after alonger irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she couldnot help sayingoh that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have noidea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. buti will not repine. it cannot last long. he will be forgot and we shallall be as we were before.elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but saidnothing.you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you haveno reason. he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of myacquaintance but that is all. i have nothing either to hope or fearand nothing to reproach him with. thank god i have not that pain. alittle time thereforei shall certainly try to get the better.with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediatelythat it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that ithas done no harm to anyone but myself.my dear jane exclaimed elizabeth you are too good. your sweetnessand disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to sayto you. i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as youdeserve.miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw backthe praise on her sisters warm affection.nay said elizabeth this is not fair. you wish to think all theworld respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody. i only wantto think you perfect and you set yourself against it. do notbe afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on yourprivilege of universal goodwill. you need not. there are few peoplewhom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well. the more i seeof the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirmsmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of thelittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit orsense. i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention theother is charlottes marriage. it is unaccountable in every view it isunaccountablemy dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these. they willruin your happiness. you do not make allowance enough for differenceof situation and temper. consider mr. collinss respectability andcharlottes steady prudent character. remember that she is one of alarge family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and beready to believe for everybodys sake that she may feel something likeregard and esteem for our cousin.to oblige you i would try to believe almost anything but no one elsecould be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded thatcharlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of herunderstanding than i now do of her heart. my dear jane mr. collins is aconceited pompous narrowminded silly man you know he is as well asi do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who married himcannot have a proper way of thinking. you shall not defend her thoughit is charlotte lucas. you shall not for the sake of one individualchange the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuadeyourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility ofdanger security for happiness.i must think your language too strong in speaking of both repliedjane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happytogether. but enough of this. you alluded to something else. youmentioned two instances. i cannot misunderstand you but i entreatyou dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame andsaying your opinion of him is sunk. we must not be so ready to fancyourselves intentionally injured. we must not expect a lively young manto be always so guarded and circumspect. it is very often nothing butour own vanity that deceives us. women fancy admiration means more thanit does.and men take care that they should.if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no ideaof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.i am far from attributing any part of mr. bingleys conduct to designsaid elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make othersunhappy there may be error and there may be misery. thoughtlessnesswant of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolutionwill do the business.and do you impute it to either of thoseyes to the last. but if i go on i shall displease you by saying whati think of persons you esteem. stop me whilst you can.you persist then in supposing his sisters influence himyes in conjunction with his friend.i cannot believe it. why should they try to influence him they canonly wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman cansecure it.your first position is false. they may wish many things besides hishappiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence theymay wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money greatconnections and pride.beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy replied janebut this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. they haveknown her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they loveher better. but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikelythey should have opposed their brothers. what sister would thinkherself at liberty to do it unless there were something veryobjectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not tryto part us if he were so they could not succeed. by supposing such anaffection you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong and me mostunhappy. do not distress me by the idea. i am not ashamed of having beenmistakenor at least it is light it is nothing in comparison of whati should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. let me take it inthe best light in the light in which it may be understood.elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr. bingleysname was scarcely ever mentioned between them.mrs. bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning nomore and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not accountfor it clearly there was little chance of her ever considering it withless perplexity. her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what shedid not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely theeffect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw herno more but though the probability of the statement was admitted atthe time she had the same story to repeat every day. mrs. bennets bestcomfort was that mr. bingley must be down again in the summer.mr. bennet treated the matter differently. so lizzy said he one dayyour sister is crossed in love i find. i congratulate her. next tobeing married a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.it is something to think of and it gives her a sort of distinctionamong her companions. when is your turn to come you will hardly bear tobe long outdone by jane. now is your time. here are officers enough inmeryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. let wickhambe your man. he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably.thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. we must notall expect janes good fortune.true said mr. bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever ofthat kind may befall you you have an affectionate mother who will makethe most of it.mr. wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloomwhich the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbournfamily. they saw him often and to his other recommendations was nowadded that of general unreserve. the whole of what elizabeth had alreadyheard his claims on mr. darcy and all that he had suffered from himwas now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and everybody waspleased to know how much they had always disliked mr. darcy before theyhad known anything of the matter.miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might beany extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the societyof hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded forallowances and urged the possibility of mistakesbut by everybody elsemr. darcy was condemned as the worst of men.chapter after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicitymr. collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival ofsaturday. the pain of separation however might be alleviated on hisside by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reasonto hope that shortly after his return into hertfordshire the day wouldbe fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. he took leave of hisrelations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his faircousins health and happiness again and promised their father anotherletter of thanks.on the following monday mrs. bennet had the pleasure of receivingher brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmasat longbourn. mr. gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatlysuperior to his sister as well by nature as education. the netherfieldladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who livedby trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been sowellbred and agreeable. mrs. gardiner who was several years youngerthan mrs. bennet and mrs. phillips was an amiable intelligent elegantwoman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces. between thetwo eldest and herself especially there subsisted a particular regard.they had frequently been staying with her in town.the first part of mrs. gardiners business on her arrival was todistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. when this wasdone she had a less active part to play. it became her turn to listen.mrs. bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of. theyhad all been very illused since she last saw her sister. two of hergirls had been upon the point of marriage and after all there wasnothing in it.i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr.bingley if she could. but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to thinkthat she might have been mr. collinss wife by this time had it notbeen for her own perverseness. he made her an offer in this very roomand she refused him. the consequence of it is that lady lucas will havea daughter married before i have and that the longbourn estate is justas much entailed as ever. the lucases are very artful people indeedsister. they are all for what they can get. i am sorry to say it ofthem but so it is. it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwartedso in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselvesbefore anybody else. however your coming just at this time is thegreatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us oflong sleeves.mrs. gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given beforein the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made hersister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned theconversation.when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject. itseems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she. i amsorry it went off. but these things happen so often a young man suchas you describe mr. bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girlfor a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgetsher that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will notdo for us. we do not suffer by accident. it does not oftenhappen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man ofindependent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently inlove with only a few days before.but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed sodoubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea. it is asoften applied to feelings which arise from a halfhours acquaintanceas to a real strong attachment. pray how violent was mr. bingleyslovei never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quiteinattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her. every timethey met it was more decided and remarkable. at his own ball heoffended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and ispoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. could there befiner symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of loveoh yesof that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt. poorjane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not getover it immediately. it had better have happened to you lizzy youwould have laughed yourself out of it sooner. but do you think shewould be prevailed upon to go back with us change of scene might beof serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful asanything.elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuadedof her sisters ready acquiescence.i hope added mrs. gardiner that no consideration with regard tothis young man will influence her. we live in so different a part oftown all our connections are so different and as you well know we goout so little that it is very improbable that they should meet at allunless he really comes to see her.and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of hisfriend and mr. darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in sucha part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr. darcy mayperhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but hewould hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from itsimpurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr. bingleynever stirs without him.so much the better. i hope they will not meet at all. but does not janecorrespond with his sister she will not be able to help calling.she will drop the acquaintance entirely.but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place thispoint as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys beingwithheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject whichconvinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirelyhopeless. it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable thathis affection might be reanimated and the influence of his friendssuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of janesattractions.miss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and thebingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as shehoped by carolines not living in the same house with her brothershe might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger ofseeing him.the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn and what with the phillipsesthe lucases and the officers there was not a day without itsengagement. mrs. bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainmentof her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a familydinner. when the engagement was for home some of the officers alwaysmade part of itof which officers mr. wickham was sure to be one andon these occasion mrs. gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabethswarm commendation narrowly observed them both. without supposing themfrom what she saw to be very seriously in love their preferenceof each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy andshe resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she lefthertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging suchan attachment.to mrs. gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasureunconnected with his general powers. about ten or a dozen years agobefore her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that verypart of derbyshire to which he belonged. they had therefore manyacquaintances in common and though wickham had been little there sincethe death of darcys father it was yet in his power to give her fresherintelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way ofprocuring.mrs. gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr. darcy bycharacter perfectly well. here consequently was an inexhaustible subjectof discourse. in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minutedescription which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute ofpraise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting bothhim and herself. on being made acquainted with the present mr. darcystreatment of him she tried to remember some of that gentlemansreputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it andwas confident at last that she recollected having heard mr. fitzwilliamdarcy formerly spoken of as a very proud illnatured boy.chapter mrs. gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly givenon the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone afterhonestly telling her what she thought she thus went onyou are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely becauseyou are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speakingopenly. seriously i would have you be on your guard. do not involveyourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the wantof fortune would make so very imprudent. i have nothing to say againsthim he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune heought to have i should think you could not do better. but as it is youmust not let your fancy run away with you. you have sense and we allexpect you to use it. your father would depend on your resolution andgood conduct i am sure. you must not disappoint your father.my dear aunt this is being serious indeed.yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise.well then you need not be under any alarm. i will take care ofmyself and of mr. wickham too. he shall not be in love with me if ican prevent it.elizabeth you are not serious now.i beg your pardon i will try again. at present i am not in love withmr. wickham no i certainly am not. but he is beyond all comparisonthe most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached tomei believe it will be better that he should not. i see the imprudenceof it. oh that abominable mr. darcy my fathers opinion of me doesme the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it. myfather however is partial to mr. wickham. in short my dear aunt ishould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy butsince we see every day that where there is affection young peopleare seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering intoengagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so manyof my fellowcreatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that itwould be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is notto be in a hurry. i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his firstobject. when i am in company with him i will not be wishing. in shorti will do my best.perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so veryoften. at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him.as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile verytrue it will be wise in me to refrain from that. but do not imaginethat he is always here so often. it is on your account that he has beenso frequently invited this week. you know my mothers ideas as to thenecessity of constant company for her friends. but really and upon myhonour i will try to do what i think to be the wisest and now i hopeyou are satisfied.her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her forthe kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advicebeing given on such a point without being resented.mr. collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quittedby the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucaseshis arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs. bennet. his marriage wasnow fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to thinkit inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone thatshe wished they might be happy. thursday was to be the wedding dayand on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when sherose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious andreluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied herout of the room. as they went downstairs together charlotte saidi shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza.that you certainly shall.and i have another favour to ask you. will you come and see mewe shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire.i am not likely to leave kent for some time. promise me therefore tocome to hunsford.elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in thevisit.my father and maria are coming to me in march added charlotte and ihope you will consent to be of the party. indeed eliza you will be aswelcome as either of them.the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent fromthe church door and everybody had as much to say or to hear onthe subject as usual. elizabeth soon heard from her friend and theircorrespondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been thatit should be equally unreserved was impossible. elizabeth could neveraddress her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was overand though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for thesake of what had been rather than what was. charlottes first letterswere received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but becuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she wouldlike lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself tobe though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotteexpressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. shewrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothingwhich she could not praise. the house furniture neighbourhood androads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was mostfriendly and obliging. it was mr. collinss picture of hunsford androsings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must waitfor her own visit there to know the rest.jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce theirsafe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped itwould be in her power to say something of the bingleys.her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatiencegenerally is. jane had been a week in town without either seeing orhearing from caroline. she accounted for it however by supposing thather last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident beenlost.my aunt she continued is going tomorrow into that part of thetown and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street.she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley.i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was veryglad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my comingto london. i was right therefore my last letter had never reachedher. i inquired after their brother of course. he was well but so muchengaged with mr. darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. i found thatmiss darcy was expected to dinner. i wish i could see her. my visit wasnot long as caroline and mrs. hurst were going out. i dare say i shallsee them soon here.elizabeth shook her head over this letter. it convinced her thataccident only could discover to mr. bingley her sisters being in town.four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him. she endeavoured topersuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer beblind to miss bingleys inattention. after waiting at home every morningfor a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her thevisitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet morethe alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself nolonger. the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister willprove what she felt.my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in herbetter judgement at my expense when i confess myself to have beenentirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me. but my dear sisterthough the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if istill assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence wasas natural as your suspicion. i do not at all comprehend her reason forwishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were tohappen again i am sure i should be deceived again. caroline did notreturn my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did ireceive in the meantime. when she did come it was very evident thatshe had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for notcalling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and wasin every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i wasperfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. i pitythough i cannot help blaming her. she was very wrong in singling me outas she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began onher side. but i pity her because she must feel that she has been actingwrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is thecause of it. i need not explain myself farther and though we knowthis anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easilyaccount for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is tohis sister whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural andamiable. i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears nowbecause if he had at all cared about me we must have met long ago.he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she saidherself and yet it would seem by her manner of talking as if shewanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy. icannot understand it. if i were not afraid of judging harshly i shouldbe almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicityin all this. but i will endeavour to banish every painful thoughtand think only of what will make me happyyour affection and theinvariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. let me hear from you verysoon. miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfieldagain of giving up the house but not with any certainty. we had betternot mention it. i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accountsfrom our friends at hunsford. pray go to see them with sir william andmaria. i am sure you will be very comfortable there.yours etc.this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as sheconsidered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least.all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. she would noteven wish for a renewal of his attentions. his character sunk onevery review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possibleadvantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr.darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantlyregret what he had thrown away.mrs. gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promiseconcerning that gentleman and required information and elizabethhad such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than toherself. his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were overhe was the admirer of some one else. elizabeth was watchful enough tosee it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain.her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfiedwith believing that she would have been his only choice had fortunepermitted it. the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the mostremarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himselfagreeable but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in this case thanin charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able tosuppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she wasready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could verysincerely wish him happy.all this was acknowledged to mrs. gardiner and after relating thecircumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt thati have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pureand elevating passion i should at present detest his very name andwish him all manner of evil. but my feelings are not only cordialtowards him they are even impartial towards miss king. i cannot findout that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling tothink her a very good sort of girl. there can be no love in all this. mywatchfulness has been effectual and though i certainly should be a moreinteresting object to all my acquaintances were i distractedly in lovewith him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance.importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. kitty and lydia takehis defection much more to heart than i do. they are young in theways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction thathandsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.chapter with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwisediversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty andsometimes cold did january and february pass away. march was to takeelizabeth to hunsford. she had not at first thought very seriously ofgoing thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the planand she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasureas well as greater certainty. absence had increased her desire of seeingcharlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr. collins. therewas novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and suchuncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little changewas not unwelcome for its own sake. the journey would moreover give hera peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would havebeen very sorry for any delay. everything however went on smoothlyand was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch. she wasto accompany sir william and his second daughter. the improvementof spending a night in london was added in time and the plan becameperfect as plan could be.the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss herand who when it came to the point so little liked her going that hetold her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter.the farewell between herself and mr. wickham was perfectly friendly onhis side even more. his present pursuit could not make him forget thatelizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention thefirst to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his mannerof bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her ofwhat she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting theiropinion of hertheir opinion of everybodywould always coincide therewas a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her tohim with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced thatwhether married or single he must always be her model of the amiableand pleasing.her fellowtravellers the next day were not of a kind to make herthink him less agreeable. sir william lucas and his daughter maria agoodhumoured girl but as emptyheaded as himself had nothing to saythat could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as muchdelight as the rattle of the chaise. elizabeth loved absurdities butshe had known sir williams too long. he could tell her nothing new ofthe wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities wereworn out like his information.it was a journey of only twentyfour miles and they began it so earlyas to be in gracechurch street by noon. as they drove to mr. gardinersdoor jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival whenthey entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabethlooking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful andlovely as ever. on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girlswhose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them towait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seenher for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower. all was joy andkindness. the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle andshopping and the evening at one of the theatres.elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. their first object was hersister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply toher minute inquiries that though jane always struggled to support herspirits there were periods of dejection. it was reasonable howeverto hope that they would not continue long. mrs. gardiner gave her theparticulars also of miss bingleys visit in gracechurch street andrepeated conversations occurring at different times between jane andherself which proved that the former had from her heart given up theacquaintance.mrs. gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion andcomplimented her on bearing it so well.but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king ishould be sorry to think our friend mercenary.pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairsbetween the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion endand avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying mebecause it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to geta girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he ismercenary.if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall knowwhat to think.she is a very good kind of girl i believe. i know no harm of her.but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers deathmade her mistress of this fortune.nowhat should he if it were not allowable for him to gain myaffections because i had no money what occasion could there be formaking love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equallypoorbut there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards herso soon after this event.a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegantdecorums which other people may observe. if she does not object to itwhy should weher not objecting does not justify him. it only shows her beingdeficient in something herselfsense or feeling.well cried elizabeth have it as you choose. he shall bemercenary and she shall be foolish.no lizzy that is what i do not choose. i should be sorry you knowto think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire.oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live inderbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are notmuch better. i am sick of them all. thank heaven i am going tomorrowwhere i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who hasneither manner nor sense to recommend him. stupid men are the only onesworth knowing after all.take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment.before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had theunexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt ina tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.we have not determined how far it shall carry us said mrs. gardinerbut perhaps to the lakes.no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and heracceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. oh my deardear aunt she rapturously cried what delight what felicity yougive me fresh life and vigour. adieu to disappointment and spleen. whatare young men to rocks and mountains oh what hours of transportwe shall spend and when we do return it shall not be like othertravellers without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. wewill know where we have gonewe will recollect what we have seen.lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in ourimaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scenewill we begin quarreling about its relative situation. let ourfirst effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality oftravellers.chapter every object in the next days journey was new and interesting toelizabeth and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment for she hadseen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her healthand the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was insearch of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view.the palings of rosings park was their boundary on one side. elizabethsmiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.at length the parsonage was discernible. the garden sloping to theroad the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedgeeverything declared they were arriving. mr. collins and charlotteappeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate whichled by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles ofthe whole party. in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicingat the sight of each other. mrs. collins welcomed her friend with theliveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied withcoming when she found herself so affectionately received. she sawinstantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriagehis formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her someminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all herfamily. they were then with no other delay than his pointing out theneatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as theywere in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatiousformality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifesoffers of refreshment.elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not helpin fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room itsaspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to heras if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. butthough everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able togratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder ather friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.when mr. collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably beashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned hereye on charlotte. once or twice she could discern a faint blush butin general charlotte wisely did not hear. after sitting long enough toadmire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard tothe fender to give an account of their journey and of all that hadhappened in london mr. collins invited them to take a stroll in thegarden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation ofwhich he attended himself. to work in this garden was one of his mostrespectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenancewith which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise andowned she encouraged it as much as possible. here leading the waythrough every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them aninterval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed outwith a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. he could number thefields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were inthe most distant clump. but of all the views which his garden or whichthe country or kingdom could boast none were to be compared with theprospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that borderedthe park nearly opposite the front of his house. it was a handsomemodern building well situated on rising ground.from his garden mr. collins would have led them round his two meadowsbut the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a whitefrost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlottetook her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleasedprobably to have the opportunity of showing it without her husbandshelp. it was rather small but well built and convenient and everythingwas fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of whichelizabeth gave charlotte all the credit. when mr. collins could beforgotten there was really an air of great comfort throughout and bycharlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be oftenforgotten.she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country. itwas spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr. collins joiningin observedyes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherinede bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you willbe delighted with her. she is all affability and condescension and idoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her noticewhen service is over. i have scarcely any hesitation in saying shewill include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which shehonours us during your stay here. her behaviour to my dear charlotte ischarming. we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowedto walk home. her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us. ishould say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several.lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed addedcharlotte and a most attentive neighbour.very true my dear that is exactly what i say. she is the sort ofwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire newsand telling again what had already been written and when it closedelizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate uponcharlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guidingand composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that itwas all done very well. she had also to anticipate how her visitwould pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatiousinterruptions of mr. collins and the gaieties of their intercourse withrosings. a lively imagination soon settled it all.about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting readyfor a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house inconfusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody runningupstairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her. she openedthe door and met maria in the landing place who breathless withagitation cried outoh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the diningroom forthere is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is. makehaste and come down this moment.elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing moreand down they ran into the diningroom which fronted the lane inquest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at thegarden gate.and is this all cried elizabeth. i expected at least that the pigswere got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and herdaughter.la my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is notlady catherine. the old lady is mrs. jenkinson who lives with themthe other is miss de bourgh. only look at her. she is quite a littlecreature. who would have thought that she could be so thin and smallshe is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind.why does she not come inoh charlotte says she hardly ever does. it is the greatest of favourswhen miss de bourgh comes in.i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas. shelooks sickly and cross. yes she will do for him very well. she willmake him a very proper wife.mr. collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversationwith the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high diversion wasstationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatnessbefore him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked thatway.at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on andthe others returned into the house. mr. collins no sooner saw the twogirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune whichcharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was askedto dine at rosings the next day.chapter mr. collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wonderingvisitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and hiswife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunityof doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of ladycatherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised byher ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening atrosings. i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that itwould happen. but who could have foreseen such an attention as this whocould have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine therean invitation moreover including the whole party so immediatelyafter your arrivali am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir williamfrom that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are whichmy situation in life has allowed me to acquire. about the court suchinstances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but theirvisit to rosings. mr. collins was carefully instructing them in whatthey were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants andso splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabethdo not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel. ladycatherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us whichbecomes herself and her daughter. i would advise you merely to put onwhatever of your clothes is superior to the restthere is no occasionfor anything more. lady catherine will not think the worse of youfor being simply dressed. she likes to have the distinction of rankpreserved.while they were dressing he came two or three times to their differentdoors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very muchobjected to be kept waiting for her dinner. such formidable accounts ofher ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucaswho had been little used to company and she looked forward to herintroduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had doneto his presentation at st. jamess.as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half amile across the park. every park has its beauty and its prospects andelizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in suchraptures as mr. collins expected the scene to inspire and was butslightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of thehouse and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originallycost sir lewis de bourgh.when they ascended the steps to the hall marias alarm was everymoment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm.elizabeths courage did not fail her. she had heard nothing of ladycatherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents ormiraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thoughtshe could witness without trepidation.from the entrancehall of which mr. collins pointed out with arapturous air the fine proportion and the finished ornaments theyfollowed the servants through an antechamber to the room where ladycatherine her daughter and mrs. jenkinson were sitting. her ladyshipwith great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs. collins hadsettled it with her husband that the office of introduction shouldbe hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of thoseapologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.in spite of having been at st. jamess sir william was so completelyawed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courageenough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a wordand his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edgeof her chair not knowing which way to look. elizabeth found herselfquite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before hercomposedly. lady catherine was a tall large woman with stronglymarkedfeatures which might once have been handsome. her air was notconciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make hervisitors forget their inferior rank. she was not rendered formidable bysilence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a toneas marked her selfimportance and brought mr. wickham immediately toelizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether shebelieved lady catherine to be exactly what he represented.when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportmentshe soon found some resemblance of mr. darcy she turned her eyes on thedaughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at herbeing so thin and so small. there was neither in figure nor face anylikeness between the ladies. miss de bourgh was pale and sickly herfeatures though not plain were insignificant and she spoke verylittle except in a low voice to mrs. jenkinson in whose appearancethere was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listeningto what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction beforeher eyes.after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows toadmire the view mr. collins attending them to point out its beautiesand lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worthlooking at in the summer.the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants andall the articles of plate which mr. collins had promised and as he hadlikewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by herladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnishnothing greater. he carved and ate and praised with delightedalacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sirwilliam who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his soninlawsaid in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear.but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration andgave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proveda novelty to them. the party did not supply much conversation. elizabethwas ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seatedbetween charlotte and miss de bourghthe former of whom was engaged inlistening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her alldinnertime. mrs. jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how littlemiss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearingshe was indisposed. maria thought speaking out of the question and thegentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.when the ladies returned to the drawingroom there was little tobe done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without anyintermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on everysubject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used tohave her judgement controverted. she inquired into charlottes domesticconcerns familiarly and minutely gave her a great deal of advice asto the management of them all told her how everything ought to beregulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to thecare of her cows and her poultry. elizabeth found that nothing wasbeneath this great ladys attention which could furnish her with anoccasion of dictating to others. in the intervals of her discoursewith mrs. collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria andelizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knewthe least and who she observed to mrs. collins was a very genteelpretty kind of girl. she asked her at different times how many sistersshe had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any ofthem were likely to be married whether they were handsome where theyhad been educated what carriage her father kept and what had beenher mothers maiden name elizabeth felt all the impertinence ofher questions but answered them very composedly. lady catherine thenobservedyour fathers estate is entailed on mr. collins i think. for yoursake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see nooccasion for entailing estates from the female line. it was not thoughtnecessary in sir lewis de bourghs family. do you play and sing missbenneta little.oh thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear you. ourinstrument is a capital one probably superior toyou shall try itsome day. do your sisters play and singone of them does.why did not you all learn you ought all to have learned. the misswebbs all play and their father has not so good an income as yours. doyou drawno not at all.what none of younot one.that is very strange. but i suppose you had no opportunity. your mothershould have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london.has your governess left youwe never had any governess.no governess how was that possible five daughters brought up at homewithout a governess i never heard of such a thing. your mother musthave been quite a slave to your education.elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not beenthe case.then who taught you who attended to you without a governess youmust have been neglected.compared with some families i believe we were but such of us aswished to learn never wanted the means. we were always encouraged toread and had all the masters that were necessary. those who chose to beidle certainly might.aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i hadknown your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engageone. i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steadyand regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it. it iswonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in thatway. i am always glad to get a young person well placed out. four niecesof mrs. jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means andit was but the other day that i recommended another young personwho was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quitedelighted with her. mrs. collins did i tell you of lady metcalfscalling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure. ladycatherine said she you have given me a treasure. are any of youryounger sisters out miss bennetyes maam all.all what all five out at once very odd and you only the second. theyounger ones out before the elder ones are married your younger sistersmust be very youngyes my youngest is not sixteen. perhaps she is full young to bemuch in company. but really maam i think it would be very hard uponyounger sisters that they should not have their share of society andamusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination tomarry early. the lastborn has as good a right to the pleasures of youthat the first. and to be kept back on such a motive i think it wouldnot be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedlyfor so young a person. pray what is your agewith three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling yourladyship can hardly expect me to own it.lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answerand elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had everdared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need notconceal your age.i am not oneandtwenty.when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the cardtableswere placed. lady catherine sir william and mr. and mrs. collins satdown to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino thetwo girls had the honour of assisting mrs. jenkinson to make up herparty. their table was superlatively stupid. scarcely a syllable wasuttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs. jenkinsonexpressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold orhaving too much or too little light. a great deal more passed at theother table. lady catherine was generally speakingstating the mistakesof the three others or relating some anecdote of herself. mr. collinswas employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said thanking herfor every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many.sir william did not say much. he was storing his memory with anecdotesand noble names.when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chosethe tables were broken up the carriage was offered to mrs. collinsgratefully accepted and immediately ordered. the party then gatheredround the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they wereto have on the morrow. from these instructions they were summoned bythe arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr.collinss side and as many bows on sir williams they departed. as soonas they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousinto give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which forcharlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was. but hercommendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfymr. collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praiseinto his own hands.chapter sir william stayed only a week at hunsford but his visit was longenough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settledand of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were notoften met with. while sir william was with them mr. collins devoted hismorning to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country butwhen he went away the whole family returned to their usual employmentsand elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of hercousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfastand dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or inreading and writing and looking out of the window in his own bookroomwhich fronted the road. the room in which the ladies sat was backwards.elizabeth had at first rather wondered that charlotte should not preferthe diningparlour for common use it was a better sized room and had amore pleasant aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellentreason for what she did for mr. collins would undoubtedly have beenmuch less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively andshe gave charlotte credit for the arrangement.from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane andwere indebted to mr. collins for the knowledge of what carriages wentalong and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaetonwhich he never failed coming to inform them of though it happenedalmost every day. she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage andhad a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely everprevailed upon to get out.very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings andnot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewiseand till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livingsto be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so manyhours. now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyshipand nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room duringthese visits. she examined into their employments looked at their workand advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangementof the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if sheaccepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of findingout that mrs. collinss joints of meat were too large for her family.elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not incommission of the peace of the county she was a most active magistratein her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to herby mr. collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed tobe quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into thevillage to settle their differences silence their complaints and scoldthem into harmony and plenty.the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a weekand allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only onecardtable in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpartof the first. their other engagements were few as the style of livingin the neighbourhood in general was beyond mr. collinss reach. thishowever was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her timecomfortably enough there were halfhours of pleasant conversation withcharlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she hadoften great enjoyment out of doors. her favourite walk and where shefrequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine wasalong the open grove which edged that side of the park where there wasa nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself andwhere she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosity.in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring anaddition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must beimportant. elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr. darcy wasexpected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were notmany of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer his coming wouldfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties andshe might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on himwere by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidentlydestined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatestsatisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration andseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen bymiss lucas and herself.his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr. collins was walkingthe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lanein order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making hisbow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the greatintelligence. on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay hisrespects. there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them formr. darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son ofhis uncle lord  and to the great surprise of all the party whenmr. collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him. charlotte had seenthem from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately runninginto the other told the girls what an honour they might expect addingi may thank you eliza for this piece of civility. mr. darcy wouldnever have come so soon to wait upon me.elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the complimentbefore their approach was announced by the doorbell and shortlyafterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. colonel fitzwilliamwho led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person andaddress most truly the gentleman. mr. darcy looked just as he had beenused to look in hertfordshirepaid his compliments with his usualreserve to mrs. collins and whatever might be his feelings toward herfriend met her with every appearance of composure. elizabeth merelycurtseyed to him without saying a word.colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with thereadiness and ease of a wellbred man and talked very pleasantly buthis cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house andgarden to mrs. collins sat for some time without speaking to anybody.at length however his civility was so far awakened as to inquire ofelizabeth after the health of her family. she answered him in the usualway and after a moments pause addedmy eldest sister has been in town these three months. have you neverhappened to see her thereshe was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to seewhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed betweenthe bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as heanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet. thesubject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards wentaway.chapter colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonageand the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasuresof their engagements at rosings. it was some days however before theyreceived any invitation thitherfor while there were visitors in thehouse they could not be necessary and it was not till easterdayalmost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured bysuch an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church tocome there in the evening. for the last week they had seen very littleof lady catherine or her daughter. colonel fitzwilliam had called at theparsonage more than once during the time but mr. darcy they had seenonly at church.the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joinedthe party in lady catherines drawingroom. her ladyship receivedthem civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means soacceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in factalmost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcymuch more than to any other person in the room.colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them anything was awelcome relief to him at rosings and mrs. collinss pretty friend hadmoreover caught his fancy very much. he now seated himself by her andtalked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and stayingat home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half sowell entertained in that room before and they conversed with so muchspirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herselfas well as of mr. darcy. his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turnedtowards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after awhile shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did notscruple to call outwhat is that you are saying fitzwilliam what is it you are talkingof what are you telling miss bennet let me hear what it is.we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoida reply.of music then pray speak aloud. it is of all subjects my delight. imust have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoymentof music than myself or a better natural taste. if i had ever learnti should have been a great proficient. and so would anne if her healthhad allowed her to apply. i am confident that she would have performeddelightfully. how does georgiana get on darcymr. darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency.i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said ladycatherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excelif she does not practice a good deal.i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice.she practises very constantly.so much the better. it cannot be done too much and when i next writeto her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. i oftentell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired withoutconstant practice. i have told miss bennet several times that shewill never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs.collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often toldher to come to rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in mrs.jenkinsons room. she would be in nobodys way you know in that partof the house.mr. darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts illbreeding and madeno answer.when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of havingpromised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument. hedrew a chair near her. lady catherine listened to half a song and thentalked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked awayfrom her and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianofortestationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performerscountenance. elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the firstconvenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and saidyou mean to frighten me mr. darcy by coming in all this state to hearme i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well. thereis a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at thewill of others. my courage always rises at every attempt to intimidateme.i shall not say you are mistaken he replied because you could notreally believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i havehad the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you findgreat enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact arenot your own.elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said tocolonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion ofme and teach you not to believe a word i say. i am particularly unluckyin meeting with a person so able to expose my real character in a partof the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree ofcredit. indeed mr. darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention allthat you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshireand give me leave tosay very impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate and suchthings may come out as will shock your relations to hear.i am not afraid of you said he smilingly.pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonelfitzwilliam. i should like to know how he behaves among strangers.you shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadful.the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must knowwas at a balland at this ball what do you think he did he dancedonly four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certainknowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of apartner. mr. darcy you cannot deny the fact.i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assemblybeyond my own party.true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ballroom. well colonelfitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders.perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought anintroduction but i am illqualified to recommend myself to strangers.shall we ask your cousin the reason of this said elizabeth stilladdressing colonel fitzwilliam. shall we ask him why a man of sense andeducation and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommendhimself to strangersi can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying tohim. it is because he will not give himself the trouble.i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcyof conversing easily with those i have never seen before. i cannotcatch their tone of conversation or appear interested in theirconcerns as i often see done.my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in themasterly manner which i see so many womens do. they have not the sameforce or rapidity and do not produce the same expression. but then ihave always supposed it to be my own faultbecause i will not take thetrouble of practising. it is not that i do not believe my fingers ascapable as any other womans of superior execution.darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right. you have employed yourtime much better. no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you canthink anything wanting. we neither of us perform to strangers.here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to knowwhat they were talking of. elizabeth immediately began playing again.lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes saidto darcymiss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more andcould have the advantage of a london master. she has a very good notionof fingering though her taste is not equal to annes. anne would havebeen a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn.elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to hiscousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could shediscern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to missde bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might havebeen just as likely to marry her had she been his relation.lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixingwith them many instructions on execution and taste. elizabeth receivedthem with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of thegentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage wasready to take them all home.chapter elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to janewhile mrs. collins and maria were gone on business into the villagewhen she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of avisitor. as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely tobe lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away herhalffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questionswhen the door opened and to her very great surprise mr. darcy andmr. darcy only entered the room.he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for hisintrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies wereto be within.they then sat down and when her inquiries after rosings were madeseemed in danger of sinking into total silence. it was absolutelynecessary therefore to think of something and in this emergencerecollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire andfeeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hastydeparture she observedhow very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr. darcyit must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see youall after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the daybefore. he and his sisters were well i hope when you left londonperfectly so i thank you.she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a shortpause addedi think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much idea of everreturning to netherfield againi have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spendvery little of his time there in the future. he has many friends andis at a time of life when friends and engagements are continuallyincreasing.if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better forthe neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then wemight possibly get a settled family there. but perhaps mr. bingley didnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood asfor his own and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the sameprinciple.i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up assoon as any eligible purchase offers.elizabeth made no answer. she was afraid of talking longer of hisfriend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave thetrouble of finding a subject to him.he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortablehouse. lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr.collins first came to hunsford.i believe she didand i am sure she could not have bestowed herkindness on a more grateful object.mr. collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with oneof the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have madehim happy if they had. my friend has an excellent understandingthoughi am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as thewisest thing she ever did.
