always the woman. i have seldom heardhim mention her under any other name. in his eyes she eclipsesand predominates the whole of her sex. it was not that he feltany emotion akin to love for irene adler. all emotions and thatone particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise butadmirably balanced mind. he was i take it the most perfectreasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as alover he would have placed himself in a false position. he neverspoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer. theywere admirable things for the observerexcellent for drawing theveil from mens motives and actions. but for the trained reasonerto admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finelyadjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor whichmight throw a doubt upon all his mental results. grit in asensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own highpowerlenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in anature such as his. and yet there was but one woman to him andthat woman was the late irene adler of dubious and questionablememory.i had seen little of holmes lately. my marriage had drifted usaway from each other. my own complete happiness and thehomecentred interests which rise up around the man who firstfinds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient toabsorb all my attention while holmes who loathed every form ofsociety with his whole bohemian soul remained in our lodgings inbaker street buried among his old books and alternating fromweek to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of thedrug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. he was stillas ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied hisimmense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation infollowing out those clues and clearing up those mysteries whichhad been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. from timeto time i heard some vague account of his doings of his summonsto odessa in the case of the trepoff murder of his clearing upof the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomaleeand finally of the mission which he had accomplished sodelicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland.beyond these signs of his activity however which i merelyshared with all the readers of the daily press i knew little ofmy former friend and companion.one nightit was on the twentieth of march i wasreturning from a journey to a patient for i had now returned tocivil practice when my way led me through baker street. as ipassed the wellremembered door which must always be associatedin my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of thestudy in scarlet i was seized with a keen desire to see holmesagain and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.his rooms were brilliantly lit and even as i looked up i sawhis tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette againstthe blind. he was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his headsunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. to me whoknew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told theirown story. he was at work again. he had risen out of hisdrugcreated dreams and was hot upon the scent of some newproblem. i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber whichhad formerly been in part my own.his manner was not effusive. it seldom was but he was glad ithink to see me. with hardly a word spoken but with a kindlyeye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigarsand indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. then hestood before the fire and looked me over in his singularintrospective fashion.wedlock suits you he remarked. i think watson that you haveput on seven and a half pounds since i saw you.seven i answered.indeed i should have thought a little more. just a trifle morei fancy watson. and in practice again i observe. you did nottell me that you intended to go into harness.then how do you knowi see it i deduce it. how do i know that you have been gettingyourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy andcareless servant girlmy dear holmes said i this is too much. you would certainlyhave been burned had you lived a few centuries ago. it is truethat i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadfulmess but as i have changed my clothes i cant imagine how youdeduce it. as to mary jane she is incorrigible and my wife hasgiven her notice but there again i fail to see how you work itout.he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous handstogether.it is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on theinside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes itthe leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. obviously theyhave been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped roundthe edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vileweather and that you had a particularly malignant bootslittingspecimen of the london slavey. as to your practice if agentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a blackmark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulgeon the right side of his tophat to show where he has secretedhis stethoscope i must be dull indeed if i do not pronouncehim to be an active member of the medical profession.i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained hisprocess of deduction. when i hear you give your reasons iremarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculouslysimple that i could easily do it myself though at eachsuccessive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until youexplain your process. and yet i believe that my eyes are as goodas yours.quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwinghimself down into an armchair. you see but you do not observe.the distinction is clear. for example you have frequently seenthe steps which lead up from the hall to this room.frequently.how oftenwell some hundreds of times.then how many are therehow many i dont know.quite so you have not observed. and yet you have seen. that isjust my point. now i know that there are seventeen stepsbecause i have both seen and observed. bytheway since you areinterested in these little problems and since you are goodenough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences youmay be interested in this. he threw over a sheet of thickpinktinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table.it came by the last post said he. read it aloud.the note was undated and without either signature or address.there will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eightoclock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon amatter of the very deepest moment. your recent services to one ofthe royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who maysafely be trusted with matters which are of an importance whichcan hardly be exaggerated. this account of you we have from allquarters received. be in your chamber then at that hour and donot take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.this is indeed a mystery i remarked. what do you imagine thatit meansi have no data yet. it is a capital mistake to theorize beforeone has data. insensibly one begins to twist facts to suittheories instead of theories to suit facts. but the note itself.what do you deduce from iti carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it waswritten.the man who wrote it was presumably well to do i remarkedendeavouring to imitate my companions processes. such papercould not be bought under half a crown a packet. it is peculiarlystrong and stiff.peculiarthat is the very word said holmes. it is not anenglish paper at all. hold it up to the light.i did so and saw a large e with a small g a p and alarge g with a small t woven into the texture of the paper.what do you make of that asked holmes.the name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather.not at all. the g with the small t stands forgesellschaft which is the german for company. it is acustomary contraction like our co. p of course stands forpapier. now for the eg. let us glance at our continentalgazetteer. he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.eglow eglonitzhere we are egria. it is in a germanspeakingcountryin bohemia not far from carlsbad. remarkable as beingthe scene of the death of wallenstein and for its numerousglassfactories and papermills. ha ha my boy what do youmake of that his eyes sparkled and he sent up a great bluetriumphant cloud from his cigarette.the paper was made in bohemia i said.precisely. and the man who wrote the note is a german. do younote the peculiar construction of the sentencethis account ofyou we have from all quarters received. a frenchman or russiancould not have written that. it is the german who is souncourteous to his verbs. it only remains therefore to discoverwhat is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper andprefers wearing a mask to showing his face. and here he comes ifi am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts.as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs andgrating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at thebell. holmes whistled.a pair by the sound said he. yes he continued glancingout of the window. a nice little brougham and a pair ofbeauties. a hundred and fifty guineas apiece. theres money inthis case watson if there is nothing else.i think that i had better go holmes.not a bit doctor. stay where you are. i am lost without myboswell. and this promises to be interesting. it would be a pityto miss it.but your clientnever mind him. i may want your help and so may he. here hecomes. sit down in that armchair doctor and give us your bestattention.a slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs andin the passage paused immediately outside the door. then therewas a loud and authoritative tap.come in said holmes.a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet sixinches in height with the chest and limbs of a hercules. hisdress was rich with a richness which would in england be lookedupon as akin to bad taste. heavy bands of astrakhan were slashedacross the sleeves and fronts of his doublebreasted coat whilethe deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was linedwith flamecoloured silk and secured at the neck with a broochwhich consisted of a single flaming beryl. boots which extendedhalfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops withrich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulencewhich was suggested by his whole appearance. he carried abroadbrimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upperpart of his face extending down past the cheekbones a blackvizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that very momentfor his hand was still raised to it as he entered. from the lowerpart of the face he appeared to be a man of strong characterwith a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestiveof resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.you had my note he asked with a deep harsh voice and astrongly marked german accent. i told you that i would call. helooked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which toaddress.pray take a seat said holmes. this is my friend andcolleague dr. watson who is occasionally good enough to help mein my cases. whom have i the honour to addressyou may address me as the count von kramm a bohemian nobleman.i understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honourand discretion whom i may trust with a matter of the mostextreme importance. if not i should much prefer to communicatewith you alone.i rose to go but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed meback into my chair. it is both or none said he. you may saybefore this gentleman anything which you may say to me.the count shrugged his broad shoulders. then i must begin saidhe by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years atthe end of that time the matter will be of no importance. atpresent it is not too much to say that it is of such weight itmay have an influence upon european history.i promise said holmes.and i.you will excuse this mask continued our strange visitor. theaugust person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown toyou and i may confess at once that the title by which i havejust called myself is not exactly my own.i was aware of it said holmes dryly.the circumstances are of great delicacy and every precautionhas to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immensescandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families ofeurope. to speak plainly the matter implicates the great houseof ormstein hereditary kings of bohemia.i was also aware of that murmured holmes settling himselfdown in his armchair and closing his eyes.our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languidlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to himas the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe.holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at hisgigantic client.if your majesty would condescend to state your case heremarked i should be better able to advise you.the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room inuncontrollable agitation. then with a gesture of desperation hetore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. youare right he cried i am the king. why should i attempt toconceal itwhy indeed murmured holmes. your majesty had not spokenbefore i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreichsigismond von ormstein grand duke of casselfelstein andhereditary king of bohemia.but you can understand said our strange visitor sitting downonce more and passing his hand over his high white forehead youcan understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business inmy own person. yet the matter was so delicate that i could notconfide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. ihave come incognito from prague for the purpose of consultingyou.then pray consult said holmes shutting his eyes once more.the facts are briefly these some five years ago during alengthy visit to warsaw i made the acquaintance of the wellknownadventuress irene adler. the name is no doubt familiar to you.kindly look her up in my index doctor murmured holmes withoutopening his eyes. for many years he had adopted a system ofdocketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that itwas difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could notat once furnish information. in this case i found her biographysandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of astaffcommander who had written a monograph upon the deepseafishes.let me see said holmes. hum born in new jersey in the year. contraltohum la scala hum prima donna imperial operaof warsawyes retired from operatic stageha living inlondonquite so your majesty as i understand became entangledwith this young person wrote her some compromising letters andis now desirous of getting those letters back.precisely so. but howwas there a secret marriagenone.no legal papers or certificatesnone.then i fail to follow your majesty. if this young person shouldproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how isshe to prove their authenticitythere is the writing.pooh pooh forgery.my private notepaper.stolen.my own seal.imitated.my photograph.bought.we were both in the photograph.oh dear that is very bad your majesty has indeed committed anindiscretion.i was madinsane.you have compromised yourself seriously.i was only crown prince then. i was young. i am but thirty now.it must be recovered.we have tried and failed.your majesty must pay. it must be bought.she will not sell.stolen then.five attempts have been made. twice burglars in my pay ransackedher house. once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. twiceshe has been waylaid. there has been no result.no sign of itabsolutely none.holmes laughed. it is quite a pretty little problem said he.but a very serious one to me returned the king reproachfully.very indeed. and what does she propose to do with thephotographto ruin me.but howi am about to be married.so i have heard.to clotilde lothman von saxemeningen second daughter of theking of scandinavia. you may know the strict principles of herfamily. she is herself the very soul of delicacy. a shadow of adoubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.and irene adlerthreatens to send them the photograph. and she will do it. iknow that she will do it. you do not know her but she has a soulof steel. she has the face of the most beautiful of women andthe mind of the most resolute of men. rather than i should marryanother woman there are no lengths to which she would notgonone.you are sure that she has not sent it yeti am sure.and whybecause she has said that she would send it on the day when thebetrothal was publicly proclaimed. that will be next monday.oh then we have three days yet said holmes with a yawn. thatis very fortunate as i have one or two matters of importance tolook into just at present. your majesty will of course stay inlondon for the presentcertainly. you will find me at the langham under the name of thecount von kramm.then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.pray do so. i shall be all anxiety.then as to moneyyou have carte blanche.absolutelyi tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdomto have that photograph.and for present expensesthe king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloakand laid it on the table.there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred innotes he said.holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook andhanded it to him.and mademoiselles address he asked.is briony lodge serpentine avenue st. johns wood.holmes took a note of it. one other question said he. was thephotograph a cabinetit was.then goodnight your majesty and i trust that we shall soonhave some good news for you. and goodnight watson he addedas the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. ifyou will be good enough to call tomorrow afternoon at threeoclock i should like to chat this little matter over with you.ii.at three oclock precisely i was at baker street but holmes hadnot yet returned. the landlady informed me that he had left thehouse shortly after eight oclock in the morning. i sat downbeside the fire however with the intention of awaiting himhowever long he might be. i was already deeply interested in hisinquiry for though it was surrounded by none of the grim andstrange features which were associated with the two crimes whichi have already recorded still the nature of the case and theexalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.indeed apart from the nature of the investigation which myfriend had on hand there was something in his masterly grasp ofa situation and his keen incisive reasoning which made it apleasure to me to study his system of work and to follow thequick subtle methods by which he disentangled the mostinextricable mysteries. so accustomed was i to his invariablesuccess that the very possibility of his failing had ceased toenter into my head.it was close upon four before the door opened and adrunkenlooking groom illkempt and sidewhiskered with aninflamed face and disreputable clothes walked into the room.accustomed as i was to my friends amazing powers in the use ofdisguises i had to look three times before i was certain that itwas indeed he. with a nod he vanished into the bedroom whence heemerged in five minutes tweedsuited and respectable as of old.putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs infront of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.well really he cried and then he choked and laughed againuntil he was obliged to lie back limp and helpless in thechair.what is itits quite too funny. i am sure you could never guess how iemployed my morning or what i ended by doing.i cant imagine. i suppose that you have been watching thehabits and perhaps the house of miss irene adler.quite so but the sequel was rather unusual. i will tell youhowever. i left the house a little after eight oclock thismorning in the character of a groom out of work. there is awonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. be one ofthem and you will know all that there is to know. i soon foundbriony lodge. it is a bijou villa with a garden at the back butbuilt out in front right up to the road two stories. chubb lockto the door. large sittingroom on the right side wellfurnished with long windows almost to the floor and thosepreposterous english window fasteners which a child could open.behind there was nothing remarkable save that the passage windowcould be reached from the top of the coachhouse. i walked roundit and examined it closely from every point of view but withoutnoting anything else of interest.i then lounged down the street and found as i expected thatthere was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of thegarden. i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horsesand received in exchange twopence a glass of half and half twofills of shag tobacco and as much information as i could desireabout miss adler to say nothing of half a dozen other people inthe neighbourhood in whom i was not in the least interested butwhose biographies i was compelled to listen to.and what of irene adler i asked.oh she has turned all the mens heads down in that part. she isthe daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. so say theserpentinemews to a man. she lives quietly sings at concertsdrives out at five every day and returns at seven sharp fordinner. seldom goes out at other times except when she sings.has only one male visitor but a good deal of him. he is darkhandsome and dashing never calls less than once a day andoften twice. he is a mr. godfrey norton of the inner temple. seethe advantages of a cabman as a confidant. they had driven himhome a dozen times from serpentinemews and knew all about him.when i had listened to all they had to tell i began to walk upand down near briony lodge once more and to think over my planof campaign.this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in thematter. he was a lawyer. that sounded ominous. what was therelation between them and what the object of his repeatedvisits was she his client his friend or his mistress if theformer she had probably transferred the photograph to hiskeeping. if the latter it was less likely. on the issue of thisquestion depended whether i should continue my work at brionylodge or turn my attention to the gentlemans chambers in thetemple. it was a delicate point and it widened the field of myinquiry. i fear that i bore you with these details but i have tolet you see my little difficulties if you are to understand thesituation.i am following you closely i answered.i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cabdrove up to briony lodge and a gentleman sprang out. he was aremarkably handsome man dark aquiline and moustachedevidently the man of whom i had heard. he appeared to be in agreat hurry shouted to the cabman to wait and brushed past themaid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughlyat home.he was in the house about half an hour and i could catchglimpses of him in the windows of the sittingroom pacing up anddown talking excitedly and waving his arms. of her i could seenothing. presently he emerged looking even more flurried thanbefore. as he stepped up to the cab he pulled a gold watch fromhis pocket and looked at it earnestly drive like the devil heshouted first to gross  hankeys in regent street and then tothe church of st. monica in the edgeware road. half a guinea ifyou do it in twenty minutesaway they went and i was just wondering whether i should not dowell to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landauthe coachman with his coat only halfbuttoned and his tie underhis ear while all the tags of his harness were sticking out ofthe buckles. it hadnt pulled up before she shot out of the halldoor and into it. i only caught a glimpse of her at the momentbut she was a lovely woman with a face that a man might die for.the church of st. monica john she cried and half asovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.this was quite too good to lose watson. i was just balancingwhether i should run for it or whether i should perch behind herlandau when a cab came through the street. the driver lookedtwice at such a shabby fare but i jumped in before he couldobject. the church of st. monica said i and half a sovereignif you reach it in twenty minutes. it was twentyfive minutes totwelve and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.my cabby drove fast. i dont think i ever drove faster but theothers were there before us. the cab and the landau with theirsteaming horses were in front of the door when i arrived. i paidthe man and hurried into the church. there was not a soul theresave the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman whoseemed to be expostulating with them. they were all threestanding in a knot in front of the altar. i lounged up the sideaisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.suddenly to my surprise the three at the altar faced round tome and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towardsme.thank god he cried. youll do. come comewhat then i asked.come man come only three minutes or it wont be legal.i was halfdragged up to the altar and before i knew where i wasi found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my earand vouching for things of which i knew nothing and generallyassisting in the secure tying up of irene adler spinster togodfrey norton bachelor. it was all done in an instant andthere was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the ladyon the other while the clergyman beamed on me in front. it wasthe most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in mylife and it was the thought of it that started me laughing justnow. it seems that there had been some informality about theirlicense that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry themwithout a witness of some sort and that my lucky appearancesaved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets insearch of a best man. the bride gave me a sovereign and i meanto wear it on my watchchain in memory of the occasion.this is a very unexpected turn of affairs said i and whatthenwell i found my plans very seriously menaced. it looked as ifthe pair might take an immediate departure and so necessitatevery prompt and energetic measures on my part. at the churchdoor however they separated he driving back to the temple andshe to her own house. i shall drive out in the park at five asusual she said as she left him. i heard no more. they droveaway in different directions and i went off to make my ownarrangements.which aresome cold beef and a glass of beer he answered ringing thebell. i have been too busy to think of food and i am likely tobe busier still this evening. by the way doctor i shall wantyour cooperation.i shall be delighted.you dont mind breaking the lawnot in the least.nor running a chance of arrestnot in a good cause.oh the cause is excellentthen i am your man.i was sure that i might rely on you.but what is it you wishwhen mrs. turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear toyou. now he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare thatour landlady had provided i must discuss it while i eat for ihave not much time. it is nearly five now. in two hours we mustbe on the scene of action. miss irene or madame rather returnsfrom her drive at seven. we must be at briony lodge to meet her.and what thenyou must leave that to me. i have already arranged what is tooccur. there is only one point on which i must insist. you mustnot interfere come what may. you understandi am to be neutralto do nothing whatever. there will probably be some smallunpleasantness. do not join in it. it will end in my beingconveyed into the house. four or five minutes afterwards thesittingroom window will open. you are to station yourself closeto that open window.yes.you are to watch me for i will be visible to you.yes.and when i raise my handsoyou will throw into the room whati give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry offire. you quite follow meentirely.it is nothing very formidable he said taking a long cigarshaped roll from his pocket. it is an ordinary plumbers smokerocket fitted with a cap at either end to make it selflighting.your task is confined to that. when you raise your cry of fireit will be taken up by quite a number of people. you may thenwalk to the end of the street and i will rejoin you in tenminutes. i hope that i have made myself cleari am to remain neutral to get near the window to watch youand at the signal to throw in this object then to raise the cryof fire and to wait you at the corner of the street.precisely.then you may entirely rely on me.that is excellent. i think perhaps it is almost time that iprepare for the new role i have to play.he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes inthe character of an amiable and simpleminded nonconformistclergyman. his broad black hat his baggy trousers his whitetie his sympathetic smile and general look of peering andbenevolent curiosity were such as mr. john hare alone could haveequalled. it was not merely that holmes changed his costume. hisexpression his manner his very soul seemed to vary with everyfresh part that he assumed. the stage lost a fine actor even asscience lost an acute reasoner when he became a specialist incrime.it was a quarter past six when we left baker street and it stillwanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves inserpentine avenue. it was already dusk and the lamps were justbeing lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodgewaiting for the coming of its occupant. the house was just suchas i had pictured it from sherlock holmes succinct descriptionbut the locality appeared to be less private than i expected. onthe contrary for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood it wasremarkably animated. there was a group of shabbily dressed mensmoking and laughing in a corner a scissorsgrinder with hiswheel two guardsmen who were flirting with a nursegirl andseveral welldressed young men who were lounging up and down withcigars in their mouths.you see remarked holmes as we paced to and fro in front ofthe house this marriage rather simplifies matters. thephotograph becomes a doubleedged weapon now. the chances arethat she would be as averse to its being seen by mr. godfreynorton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of hisprincess. now the question is where are we to find thephotographwhere indeedit is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. it iscabinet size. too large for easy concealment about a womansdress. she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaidand searched. two attempts of the sort have already been made. wemay take it then that she does not carry it about with her.where thenher banker or her lawyer. there is that double possibility. buti am inclined to think neither. women are naturally secretiveand they like to do their own secreting. why should she hand itover to anyone else she could trust her own guardianship butshe could not tell what indirect or political influence might bebrought to bear upon a business man. besides remember that shehad resolved to use it within a few days. it must be where shecan lay her hands upon it. it must be in her own house.but it has twice been burgled.pshaw they did not know how to look.but how will you looki will not look.what theni will get her to show me.but she will refuse.she will not be able to. but i hear the rumble of wheels. it isher carriage. now carry out my orders to the letter.as he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came roundthe curve of the avenue. it was a smart little landau whichrattled up to the door of briony lodge. as it pulled up one ofthe loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door inthe hope of earning a copper but was elbowed away by anotherloafer who had rushed up with the same intention. a fiercequarrel broke out which was increased by the two guardsmen whotook sides with one of the loungers and by the scissorsgrinderwho was equally hot upon the other side. a blow was struck andin an instant the lady who had stepped from her carriage wasthe centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men whostruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. holmesdashed into the crowd to protect the lady but just as he reachedher he gave a cry and dropped to the ground with the bloodrunning freely down his face. at his fall the guardsmen took totheir heels in one direction and the loungers in the other whilea number of betterdressed people who had watched the scufflewithout taking part in it crowded in to help the lady and toattend to the injured man. irene adler as i will still call herhad hurried up the steps but she stood at the top with hersuperb figure outlined against the lights of the hall lookingback into the street.is the poor gentleman much hurt she asked.he is dead cried several voices.no no theres life in him shouted another. but hell begone before you can get him to hospital.hes a brave fellow said a woman. they would have had theladys purse and watch if it hadnt been for him. they were agang and a rough one too. ah hes breathing now.he cant lie in the street. may we bring him in marmsurely. bring him into the sittingroom. there is a comfortablesofa. this way pleaseslowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid outin the principal room while i still observed the proceedingsfrom my post by the window. the lamps had been lit but theblinds had not been drawn so that i could see holmes as he layupon the couch. i do not know whether he was seized withcompunction at that moment for the part he was playing but iknow that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my lifethan when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i wasconspiring or the grace and kindliness with which she waitedupon the injured man. and yet it would be the blackest treacheryto holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrustedto me. i hardened my heart and took the smokerocket from undermy ulster. after all i thought we are not injuring her. we arebut preventing her from injuring another.holmes had sat up upon the couch and i saw him motion like a manwho is in need of air. a maid rushed across and threw open thewindow. at the same instant i saw him raise his hand and at thesignal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of fire theword was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd ofspectators well dressed and illgentlemen ostlers andservantmaidsjoined in a general shriek of fire thick cloudsof smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. icaught a glimpse of rushing figures and a moment later the voiceof holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the cornerof the street and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find myfriends arm in mine and to get away from the scene of uproar.he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until wehad turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards theedgeware road.you did it very nicely doctor he remarked. nothing couldhave been better. it is all right.you have the photographi know where it is.and how did you find outshe showed me as i told you she would.i am still in the dark.i do not wish to make a mystery said he laughing. the matterwas perfectly simple. you of course saw that everyone in thestreet was an accomplice. they were all engaged for the evening.i guessed as much.then when the row broke out i had a little moist red paint inthe palm of my hand. i rushed forward fell down clapped my handto my face and became a piteous spectacle. it is an old trick.that also i could fathom.then they carried me in. she was bound to have me in. what elsecould she do and into her sittingroom which was the very roomwhich i suspected. it lay between that and her bedroom and i wasdetermined to see which. they laid me on a couch i motioned forair they were compelled to open the window and you had yourchance.how did that help youit was allimportant. when a woman thinks that her house is onfire her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which shevalues most. it is a perfectly overpowering impulse and i havemore than once taken advantage of it. in the case of thedarlington substitution scandal it was of use to me and also inthe arnsworth castle business. a married woman grabs at her babyan unmarried one reaches for her jewelbox. now it was clear tome that our lady of today had nothing in the house more preciousto her than what we are in quest of. she would rush to secure it.the alarm of fire was admirably done. the smoke and shouting wereenough to shake nerves of steel. she responded beautifully. thephotograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above theright bellpull. she was there in an instant and i caught aglimpse of it as she halfdrew it out. when i cried out that itwas a false alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushedfrom the room and i have not seen her since. i rose and makingmy excuses escaped from the house. i hesitated whether toattempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman hadcome in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer towait. a little overprecipitance may ruin all.and now i asked.our quest is practically finished. i shall call with the kingtomorrow and with you if you care to come with us. we will beshown into the sittingroom to wait for the lady but it isprobable that when she comes she may find neither us nor thephotograph. it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regainit with his own hands.and when will you callat eight in the morning. she will not be up so that we shallhave a clear field. besides we must be prompt for this marriagemay mean a complete change in her life and habits. i must wire tothe king without delay.we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door. he wassearching his pockets for the key when someone passing saidgoodnight mister sherlock holmes.there were several people on the pavement at the time but thegreeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who hadhurried by.ive heard that voice before said holmes staring down thedimly lit street. now i wonder who the deuce that could havebeen.iii.i slept at baker street that night and we were engaged upon ourtoast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushedinto the room.you have really got it he cried grasping sherlock holmes byeither shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.not yet.but you have hopesi have hopes.then come. i am all impatience to be gone.we must have a cab.no my brougham is waiting.then that will simplify matters. we descended and started offonce more for briony lodge.irene adler is married remarked holmes.married whenyesterday.but to whomto an english lawyer named norton.but she could not love him.i am in hopes that she does.and why in hopesbecause it would spare your majesty all fear of futureannoyance. if the lady loves her husband she does not love yourmajesty. if she does not love your majesty there is no reasonwhy she should interfere with your majestys plan.it is true. and yetwell i wish she had been of my ownstation what a queen she would have made he relapsed into amoody silence which was not broken until we drew up inserpentine avenue.the door of briony lodge was open and an elderly woman stoodupon the steps. she watched us with a sardonic eye as we steppedfrom the brougham.mr. sherlock holmes i believe said she.i am mr. holmes answered my companion looking at her with aquestioning and rather startled gaze.indeed my mistress told me that you were likely to call. sheleft this morning with her husband by the  train from charingcross for the continent.what sherlock holmes staggered back white with chagrin andsurprise. do you mean that she has left englandnever to return.and the papers asked the king hoarsely. all is lost.we shall see. he pushed past the servant and rushed into thedrawingroom followed by the king and myself. the furniture wasscattered about in every direction with dismantled shelves andopen drawers as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them beforeher flight. holmes rushed at the bellpull tore back a smallsliding shutter and plunging in his hand pulled out aphotograph and a letter. the photograph was of irene adlerherself in evening dress the letter was superscribed tosherlock holmes esq. to be left till called for. my friendtore it open and we all three read it together. it was dated atmidnight of the preceding night and ran in this waymy dear mr. sherlock holmesyou really did it very well. youtook me in completely. until after the alarm of fire i had not asuspicion. but then when i found how i had betrayed myself ibegan to think. i had been warned against you months ago. i hadbeen told that if the king employed an agent it would certainlybe you. and your address had been given me. yet with all thisyou made me reveal what you wanted to know. even after i becamesuspicious i found it hard to think evil of such a dear kindold clergyman. but you know i have been trained as an actressmyself. male costume is nothing new to me. i often take advantageof the freedom which it gives. i sent john the coachman towatch you ran up stairs got into my walkingclothes as i callthem and came down just as you departed.well i followed you to your door and so made sure that i wasreally an object of interest to the celebrated mr. sherlockholmes. then i rather imprudently wished you goodnight andstarted for the temple to see my husband.we both thought the best resource was flight when pursued byso formidable an antagonist so you will find the nest empty whenyou call tomorrow. as to the photograph your client may rest inpeace. i love and am loved by a better man than he. the king maydo what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruellywronged. i keep it only to safeguard myself and to preserve aweapon which will always secure me from any steps which he mighttake in the future. i leave a photograph which he might care topossess and i remain dear mr. sherlock holmes                                      very truly yours                                   irene norton ne adler.what a womanoh what a woman cried the king of bohemia whenwe had all three read this epistle. did i not tell you how quickand resolute she was would she not have made an admirable queenis it not a pity that she was not on my levelfrom what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on avery different level to your majesty said holmes coldly. i amsorry that i have not been able to bring your majestys businessto a more successful conclusion.on the contrary my dear sir cried the king nothing could bemore successful. i know that her word is inviolate. thephotograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.i am glad to hear your majesty say so.i am immensely indebted to you. pray tell me in what way i canreward you. this ring he slipped an emerald snake ring fromhis finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.your majesty has something which i should value even morehighly said holmes.you have but to name it.this photographthe king stared at him in amazement.irenes photograph he cried. certainly if you wish it.i thank your majesty. then there is no more to be done in thematter. i have the honour to wish you a very goodmorning. hebowed and turning away without observing the hand which theking had stretched out to him he set off in my company for hischambers.and that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdomof bohemia and how the best plans of mr. sherlock holmes werebeaten by a womans wit. he used to make merry over thecleverness of women but i have not heard him do it of late. andwhen he speaks of irene adler or when he refers to herphotograph it is always under the honourable title of the woman.adventure ii. the redheaded leaguei had called upon my friend mr. sherlock holmes one day in theautumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with avery stout floridfaced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.with an apology for my intrusion i was about to withdraw whenholmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the doorbehind me.you could not possibly have come at a better time my dearwatson he said cordially.i was afraid that you were engaged.so i am. very much so.then i can wait in the next room.not at all. this gentleman mr. wilson has been my partner andhelper in many of my most successful cases and i have nodoubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob ofgreeting with a quick little questioning glance from his smallfatencircled eyes.try the settee said holmes relapsing into his armchair andputting his fingertips together as was his custom when injudicial moods. i know my dear watson that you share my loveof all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrumroutine of everyday life. you have shown your relish for it bythe enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle and if youwill excuse my saying so somewhat to embellish so many of my ownlittle adventures.your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me iobserved.you will remember that i remarked the other day just before wewent into the very simple problem presented by miss marysutherland that for strange effects and extraordinarycombinations we must go to life itself which is always far moredaring than any effort of the imagination.a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting.you did doctor but none the less you must come round to myview for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on youuntil your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me tobe right. now mr. jabez wilson here has been good enough to callupon me this morning and to begin a narrative which promises tobe one of the most singular which i have listened to for sometime. you have heard me remark that the strangest and most uniquethings are very often connected not with the larger but with thesmaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room fordoubt whether any positive crime has been committed. as far as ihave heard it is impossible for me to say whether the presentcase is an instance of crime or not but the course of events iscertainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to.perhaps mr. wilson you would have the great kindness torecommence your narrative. i ask you not merely because my frienddr. watson has not heard the opening part but also because thepeculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have everypossible detail from your lips. as a rule when i have heard someslight indication of the course of events i am able to guidemyself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to mymemory. in the present instance i am forced to admit that thefacts are to the best of my belief unique.the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of somelittle pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from theinside pocket of his greatcoat. as he glanced down theadvertisement column with his head thrust forward and the paperflattened out upon his knee i took a good look at the man andendeavoured after the fashion of my companion to read theindications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.i did not gain very much however by my inspection. our visitorbore every mark of being an average commonplace britishtradesman obese pompous and slow. he wore rather baggy greyshepherds check trousers a not overclean black frockcoatunbuttoned in the front and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassyalbert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down asan ornament. a frayed tophat and a faded brown overcoat with awrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. altogetherlook as i would there was nothing remarkable about the man savehis blazing red head and the expression of extreme chagrin anddiscontent upon his features.sherlock holmes quick eye took in my occupation and he shookhis head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manuallabour that he takes snuff that he is a freemason that he hasbeen in china and that he has done a considerable amount ofwriting lately i can deduce nothing else.mr. jabez wilson started up in his chair with his forefingerupon the paper but his eyes upon my companion.how in the name of goodfortune did you know all that mr.holmes he asked. how did you know for example that i didmanual labour. its as true as gospel for i began as a shipscarpenter.your hands my dear sir. your right hand is quite a size largerthan your left. you have worked with it and the muscles are moredeveloped.well the snuff then and the freemasonryi wont insult your intelligence by telling you how i read thatespecially as rather against the strict rules of your order youuse an arcandcompass breastpin.ah of course i forgot that. but the writingwhat else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny forfive inches and the left one with the smooth patch near theelbow where you rest it upon the deskwell but chinathe fish that you have tattooed immediately above your rightwrist could only have been done in china. i have made a smallstudy of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literatureof the subject. that trick of staining the fishes scales of adelicate pink is quite peculiar to china. when in addition isee a chinese coin hanging from your watchchain the matterbecomes even more simple.mr. jabez wilson laughed heavily. well i never said he. ithought at first that you had done something clever but i seethat there was nothing in it after all.i begin to think watson said holmes that i make a mistakein explaining. omne ignotum pro magnifico you know and mypoor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if iam so candid. can you not find the advertisement mr. wilsonyes i have got it now he answered with his thick red fingerplanted halfway down the column. here it is. this is what beganit all. you just read it for yourself sir.i took the paper from him and read as followsto the redheaded league on account of the bequest of the lateezekiah hopkins of lebanon pennsylvania u. s. a. there is nowanother vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to asalary of  pounds a week for purely nominal services. allredheaded men who are sound in body and mind and above the ageof twentyone years are eligible. apply in person on monday ateleven oclock to duncan ross at the offices of the league popes court fleet street.what on earth does this mean i ejaculated after i had twiceread over the extraordinary announcement.holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit whenin high spirits. it is a little off the beaten track isnt itsaid he. and now mr. wilson off you go at scratch and tell usall about yourself your household and the effect which thisadvertisement had upon your fortunes. you will first make a notedoctor of the paper and the date.it is the morning chronicle of april  . just two monthsago.very good. now mr. wilsonwell it is just as i have been telling you mr. sherlockholmes said jabez wilson mopping his forehead i have a smallpawnbrokers business at coburg square near the city. its not avery large affair and of late years it has not done more thanjust give me a living. i used to be able to keep two assistantsbut now i only keep one and i would have a job to pay him butthat he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn thebusiness.what is the name of this obliging youth asked sherlock holmes.his name is vincent spaulding and hes not such a youtheither. its hard to say his age. i should not wish a smarterassistant mr. holmes and i know very well that he could betterhimself and earn twice what i am able to give him. but afterall if he is satisfied why should i put ideas in his headwhy indeed you seem most fortunate in having an employ whocomes under the full market price. it is not a common experienceamong employers in this age. i dont know that your assistant isnot as remarkable as your advertisement.oh he has his faults too said mr. wilson. never was such afellow for photography. snapping away with a camera when he oughtto be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellarlike a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. that is hismain fault but on the whole hes a good worker. theres no vicein him.he is still with you i presumeyes sir. he and a girl of fourteen who does a bit of simplecooking and keeps the place cleanthats all i have in thehouse for i am a widower and never had any family. we live veryquietly sir the three of us and we keep a roof over our headsand pay our debts if we do nothing more.the first thing that put us out was that advertisement.spaulding he came down into the office just this day eightweeks with this very paper in his hand and he saysi wish to the lord mr. wilson that i was a redheaded man.why that i asks.why says he heres another vacancy on the league of theredheaded men. its worth quite a little fortune to any man whogets it and i understand that there are more vacancies thanthere are men so that the trustees are at their wits end whatto do with the money. if my hair would only change colour heresa nice little crib all ready for me to step into.why what is it then i asked. you see mr. holmes i am avery stayathome man and as my business came to me instead ofmy having to go to it i was often weeks on end without puttingmy foot over the doormat. in that way i didnt know much of whatwas going on outside and i was always glad of a bit of news.have you never heard of the league of the redheaded men heasked with his eyes open.never.why i wonder at that for you are eligible yourself for oneof the vacancies.and what are they worth i asked.oh merely a couple of hundred a year but the work is slightand it need not interfere very much with ones otheroccupations.well you can easily think that that made me prick up my earsfor the business has not been overgood for some years and anextra couple of hundred would have been very handy.tell me all about it said i.well said he showing me the advertisement you can see foryourself that the league has a vacancy and there is the addresswhere you should apply for particulars. as far as i can make outthe league was founded by an american millionaire ezekiahhopkins who was very peculiar in his ways. he was himselfredheaded and he had a great sympathy for all redheaded menso when he died it was found that he had left his enormousfortune in the hands of trustees with instructions to apply theinterest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is ofthat colour. from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little todo.but said i there would be millions of redheaded men whowould apply.not so many as you might think he answered. you see it isreally confined to londoners and to grown men. this american hadstarted from london when he was young and he wanted to do theold town a good turn. then again i have heard it is no use yourapplying if your hair is light red or dark red or anything butreal bright blazing fiery red. now if you cared to apply mr.wilson you would just walk in but perhaps it would hardly beworth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of afew hundred pounds.now it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselvesthat my hair is of a very full and rich tint so that it seemedto me that if there was to be any competition in the matter istood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met. vincentspaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he mightprove useful so i just ordered him to put up the shutters forthe day and to come right away with me. he was very willing tohave a holiday so we shut the business up and started off forthe address that was given us in the advertisement.i never hope to see such a sight as that again mr. holmes. fromnorth south east and west every man who had a shade of red inhis hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.fleet street was choked with redheaded folk and popes courtlooked like a costers orange barrow. i should not have thoughtthere were so many in the whole country as were brought togetherby that single advertisement. every shade of colour theywerestraw lemon orange brick irishsetter liver claybut as spaulding said there were not many who had the realvivid flamecoloured tint. when i saw how many were waiting iwould have given it up in despair but spaulding would not hearof it. how he did it i could not imagine but he pushed andpulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right upto the steps which led to the office. there was a double streamupon the stair some going up in hope and some coming backdejected but we wedged in as well as we could and soon foundourselves in the office.your experience has been a most entertaining one remarkedholmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a hugepinch of snuff. pray continue your very interesting statement.there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairsand a deal table behind which sat a small man with a head thatwas even redder than mine. he said a few words to each candidateas he came up and then he always managed to find some fault inthem which would disqualify them. getting a vacancy did not seemto be such a very easy matter after all. however when our turncame the little man was much more favourable to me than to any ofthe others and he closed the door as we entered so that hemight have a private word with us.this is mr. jabez wilson said my assistant and he iswilling to fill a vacancy in the league.and he is admirably suited for it the other answered. he hasevery requirement. i cannot recall when i have seen anything sofine. he took a step backward cocked his head on one side andgazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful. then suddenly heplunged forward wrung my hand and congratulated me warmly on mysuccess.it would be injustice to hesitate said he. you willhowever i am sure excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.with that he seized my hair in both his hands and tugged until iyelled with the pain. there is water in your eyes said he ashe released me. i perceive that all is as it should be. but wehave to be careful for we have twice been deceived by wigs andonce by paint. i could tell you tales of cobblers wax whichwould disgust you with human nature. he stepped over to thewindow and shouted through it at the top of his voice that thevacancy was filled. a groan of disappointment came up from belowand the folk all trooped away in different directions until therewas not a redhead to be seen except my own and that of themanager.my name said he is mr. duncan ross and i am myself one ofthe pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. areyou a married man mr. wilson have you a familyi answered that i had not.his face fell immediately.dear me he said gravely that is very serious indeed i amsorry to hear you say that. the fund was of course for thepropagation and spread of the redheads as well as for theirmaintenance. it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be abachelor.my face lengthened at this mr. holmes for i thought that i wasnot to have the vacancy after all but after thinking it over fora few minutes he said that it would be all right.in the case of another said he the objection might befatal but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such ahead of hair as yours. when shall you be able to enter upon yournew dutieswell it is a little awkward for i have a business alreadysaid i.oh never mind about that mr. wilson said vincent spaulding.i should be able to look after that for you.what would be the hours i asked.ten to two.now a pawnbrokers business is mostly done of an evening mr.holmes especially thursday and friday evening which is justbefore payday so it would suit me very well to earn a little inthe mornings. besides i knew that my assistant was a good manand that he would see to anything that turned up.that would suit me very well said i. and the payis  pounds a week.and the workis purely nominal.what do you call purely nominalwell you have to be in the office or at least in thebuilding the whole time. if you leave you forfeit your wholeposition forever. the will is very clear upon that point. youdont comply with the conditions if you budge from the officeduring that time.its only four hours a day and i should not think of leavingsaid i.no excuse will avail said mr. duncan ross neither sicknessnor business nor anything else. there you must stay or you loseyour billet.and the workis to copy out the encyclopaedia britannica. there is the firstvolume of it in that press. you must find your own ink pens andblottingpaper but we provide this table and chair. will you beready tomorrowcertainly i answered.then goodbye mr. jabez wilson and let me congratulate youonce more on the important position which you have been fortunateenough to gain. he bowed me out of the room and i went home withmy assistant hardly knowing what to say or do i was so pleasedat my own good fortune.well i thought over the matter all day and by evening i was inlow spirits again for i had quite persuaded myself that thewhole affair must be some great hoax or fraud though what itsobject might be i could not imagine. it seemed altogether pastbelief that anyone could make such a will or that they would paysuch a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out theencyclopaedia britannica. vincent spaulding did what he could tocheer me up but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of thewhole thing. however in the morning i determined to have a lookat it anyhow so i bought a penny bottle of ink and with aquillpen and seven sheets of foolscap paper i started off forpopes court.well to my surprise and delight everything was as right aspossible. the table was set out ready for me and mr. duncan rosswas there to see that i got fairly to work. he started me offupon the letter a and then he left me but he would drop in fromtime to time to see that all was right with me. at two oclock hebade me goodday complimented me upon the amount that i hadwritten and locked the door of the office after me.this went on day after day mr. holmes and on saturday themanager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for myweeks work. it was the same next week and the same the weekafter. every morning i was there at ten and every afternoon ileft at two. by degrees mr. duncan ross took to coming in onlyonce of a morning and then after a time he did not come in atall. still of course i never dared to leave the room for aninstant for i was not sure when he might come and the billetwas such a good one and suited me so well that i would not riskthe loss of it.eight weeks passed away like this and i had written aboutabbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica andhoped with diligence that i might get on to the bs before verylong. it cost me something in foolscap and i had pretty nearlyfilled a shelf with my writings. and then suddenly the wholebusiness came to an end.to an endyes sir. and no later than this morning. i went to my work asusual at ten oclock but the door was shut and locked with alittle square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of thepanel with a tack. here it is and you can read for yourself.he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheetof notepaper. it read in this fashion                  the redheaded league                           is                        dissolved.                     october  .sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and therueful face behind it until the comical side of the affair socompletely overtopped every other consideration that we bothburst out into a roar of laughter.i cannot see that there is anything very funny cried ourclient flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. if you cando nothing better than laugh at me i can go elsewhere.no no cried holmes shoving him back into the chair fromwhich he had half risen. i really wouldnt miss your case forthe world. it is most refreshingly unusual. but there is if youwill excuse my saying so something just a little funny about it.pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon thedoori was staggered sir. i did not know what to do. then i calledat the offices round but none of them seemed to know anythingabout it. finally i went to the landlord who is an accountantliving on the groundfloor and i asked him if he could tell mewhat had become of the redheaded league. he said that he hadnever heard of any such body. then i asked him who mr. duncanross was. he answered that the name was new to him.well said i the gentleman at no. .what the redheaded manyes.oh said he his name was william morris. he was a solicitorand was using my room as a temporary convenience until his newpremises were ready. he moved out yesterday.where could i find himoh at his new offices. he did tell me the address. yes king edward street near st. pauls.i started off mr. holmes but when i got to that address it wasa manufactory of artificial kneecaps and no one in it had everheard of either mr. william morris or mr. duncan ross.and what did you do then asked holmes.i went home to saxecoburg square and i took the advice of myassistant. but he could not help me in any way. he could only saythat if i waited i should hear by post. but that was not quitegood enough mr. holmes. i did not wish to lose such a placewithout a struggle so as i had heard that you were good enoughto give advice to poor folk who were in need of it i came rightaway to you.and you did very wisely said holmes. your case is anexceedingly remarkable one and i shall be happy to look into it.from what you have told me i think that it is possible thatgraver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.grave enough said mr. jabez wilson. why i have lost fourpound a week.as far as you are personally concerned remarked holmes i donot see that you have any grievance against this extraordinaryleague. on the contrary you are as i understand richer by some pounds to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you havegained on every subject which comes under the letter a. you havelost nothing by them.no sir. but i want to find out about them and who they areand what their object was in playing this prankif it was aprankupon me. it was a pretty expensive joke for them for itcost them two and thirty pounds.we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. and firstone or two questions mr. wilson. this assistant of yours whofirst called your attention to the advertisementhow long had hebeen with youabout a month then.how did he comein answer to an advertisement.was he the only applicantno i had a dozen.why did you pick himbecause he was handy and would come cheap.at halfwages in fact.yes.what is he like this vincent spauldingsmall stoutbuilt very quick in his ways no hair on his facethough hes not short of thirty. has a white splash of acid uponhis forehead.holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. i thoughtas much said he. have you ever observed that his ears arepierced for earringsyes sir. he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when hewas a lad.hum said holmes sinking back in deep thought. he is stillwith youoh yes sir i have only just left him.and has your business been attended to in your absencenothing to complain of sir. theres never very much to do of amorning.that will do mr. wilson. i shall be happy to give you anopinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. today issaturday and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion.well watson said holmes when our visitor had left us whatdo you make of it alli make nothing of it i answered frankly. it is a mostmysterious business.as a rule said holmes the more bizarre a thing is the lessmysterious it proves to be. it is your commonplace featurelesscrimes which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face isthe most difficult to identify. but i must be prompt over thismatter.what are you going to do then i asked.to smoke he answered. it is quite a three pipe problem and ibeg that you wont speak to me for fifty minutes. he curledhimself up in his chair with his thin knees drawn up to hishawklike nose and there he sat with his eyes closed and hisblack clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep andindeed was nodding myself when he suddenly sprang out of hischair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and puthis pipe down upon the mantelpiece.sarasate plays at the st. jamess hall this afternoon heremarked. what do you think watson could your patients spareyou for a few hoursi have nothing to do today. my practice is never veryabsorbing.then put on your hat and come. i am going through the cityfirst and we can have some lunch on the way. i observe thatthere is a good deal of german music on the programme which israther more to my taste than italian or french. it isintrospective and i want to introspect. come alongwe travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate and a shortwalk took us to saxecoburg square the scene of the singularstory which we had listened to in the morning. it was a pokylittle shabbygenteel place where four lines of dingytwostoried brick houses looked out into a small railedinenclosure where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of fadedlaurelbushes made a hard fight against a smokeladen anduncongenial atmosphere. three gilt balls and a brown board withjabez wilson in white letters upon a corner house announcedthe place where our redheaded client carried on his business.sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one sideand looked it all over with his eyes shining brightly betweenpuckered lids. then he walked slowly up the street and then downagain to the corner still looking keenly at the houses. finallyhe returned to the pawnbrokers and having thumped vigorouslyupon the pavement with his stick two or three times he went upto the door and knocked. it was instantly opened by abrightlooking cleanshaven young fellow who asked him to stepin.thank you said holmes i only wished to ask you how you wouldgo from here to the strand.third right fourth left answered the assistant promptlyclosing the door.smart fellow that observed holmes as we walked away. he isin my judgment the fourth smartest man in london and for daringi am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. i have knownsomething of him before.evidently said i mr. wilsons assistant counts for a gooddeal in this mystery of the redheaded league. i am sure that youinquired your way merely in order that you might see him.not him.what thenthe knees of his trousers.and what did you seewhat i expected to see.why did you beat the pavementmy dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk. weare spies in an enemys country. we know something of saxecoburgsquare. let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round thecorner from the retired saxecoburg square presented as great acontrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. it wasone of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the cityto the north and west. the roadway was blocked with the immensestream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outwardwhile the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm ofpedestrians. it was difficult to realise as we looked at the lineof fine shops and stately business premises that they reallyabutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant squarewhich we had just quitted.let me see said holmes standing at the corner and glancingalong the line i should like just to remember the order of thehouses here. it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge oflondon. there is mortimers the tobacconist the littlenewspaper shop the coburg branch of the city and suburban bankthe vegetarian restaurant and mcfarlanes carriagebuildingdepot. that carries us right on to the other block. and nowdoctor weve done our work so its time we had some play. asandwich and a cup of coffee and then off to violinland whereall is sweetness and delicacy and harmony and there are noredheaded clients to vex us with their conundrums.my friend was an enthusiastic musician being himself not only avery capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. allthe afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfecthappiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to themusic while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyeswere as unlike those of holmes the sleuthhound holmes therelentless keenwitted readyhanded criminal agent as it waspossible to conceive. in his singular character the dual naturealternately asserted itself and his extreme exactness andastuteness represented as i have often thought the reactionagainst the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionallypredominated in him. the swing of his nature took him fromextreme languor to devouring energy and as i knew well he wasnever so truly formidable as when for days on end he had beenlounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and hisblackletter editions. then it was that the l
